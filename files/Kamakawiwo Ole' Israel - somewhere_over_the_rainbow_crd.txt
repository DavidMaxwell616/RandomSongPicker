Kamakawiwo Ole' Israel
Somewhere Over The Rainbow / What a Wonderful World
--------------------------


C         G
Somewhere over the rainbow

Am      C
Way up high

F        C
And the dreams...

G               Am   F
Once in a lullaby

C         G
Somewhere over...

Am          C
Blue birds fly

F        C
And the dreams...

G                     Am     F
Dreams really do come true

C
Someday...

G                                   Am     F
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me

C
Where trouble...

G                               Am            F
High above the chimney tops is where you'll find me

C         G                Am        C
Somewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly

F       C                         G                  Am     F
And the dreams that you dare to, oh why, oh why can't I?

C                    G         Am        C
Well I see trees of green and Red roses too,

F               C         G       Am
I'll watch then bloom for me and you

F
And I think...

G                 Am    F
What a wonderful world

C                   G              Am          C
Well I see skies of blue and I see clouds of white

F                     C
And the brightness of day

G           Am
I like the dark

F
And I think...

G                Am    F
What a wonderful world

G                            Am
The colors of the rainbow so pr...

G                        Am
Are also on the faces of pe...

F                     C
I see friends shaking h...

         F           C
Saying, "How do you do?"

F              C        F         G
They're really saying, I...I love you

C             G          Am         C
I hear babies cry and I watch them grow,

F                  C
They'll learn much more

G           Am
Than we'll know

F
And I think to myself

G                 Am    F
What a wonderful world

C
Someday I'll wish...

G                   Am     F
Wake up where ... behind me

C
Where trouble...

G               Am           F
High above ... where you'll find me

C          G
Somewhere over...

Am      C
Way up high

F        C                         G                  Am   F    C
And the dreams that you dare to, oh why, oh why can't I?

The Am in a few places doesn't sound quite right, but I'm lazy.
Hope you enjoy this beautiful song. Sounds even better on a ukelele.
