Artist: Tom Waits Lyrics
Song: Little Drop Of Poison Lyrics

Cm                                     Fm
I like my town with a little drop of poison
        G7                            Cm
Nobody knows they're lining up to go insane
I'm all alone, I smoke my friends down to the filter
But I feel much cleaner after it rains

Cm
She left in the fall, that's her picture on the wall
                                    Fm     G7
She always had that little drop of poison

Did the devil make the world while god was sleeping
Someone said you'll never get a wish from a bone
Another wrong good-bye and a hundred sailors
That deep blue sky is my home

She left in the fall, that's her picture on the wall
She always had that little drop of poison
She left in the fall, that's her picture on the wall
She always had that little drop of poison

up 1/2 step

A rat always knows when he's in with weasels
Here you lose a little every day
I remember when a million was a million
They all have ways to make you pay
They all have ways to make you pay
