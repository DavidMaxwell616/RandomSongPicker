  I'll stick around, I'll stick around...


I thought I knew all it took to bother you
every word I said was true that you'll see

how could it be I'm the only one who sees your rehearsed insanity

I still refuse all the methods you've abused
it's all right if you're confused let me be

I've been around all the pawns
you've gagged and bound
they'll come back and knock you down and i'll be free

I've taken all and I've endured
one day it all will fade
I'm sure

I don't owe you anything

I had no other hand in your ever desperate plan
it returns and when it lands words are due

I should've known we were better off alone
I looked in and I was shown
you were too

I've taken all and I've endured
one day it all will fade
I'm sure

I don't owe you anything

I'll stick around and learn
from all that came from it
