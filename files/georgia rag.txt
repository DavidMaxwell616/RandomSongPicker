E7
Down in Atlanta on Harris Street
That's where all the boys and gals do meet
A7            D7            G
doin that rag that Georgia rag

Out in the alley in the street
every little kid that you meet
doin that rag that Georgia rag
Spank that Georgia rag, boy!

G E A7 D7 B7

Chorus:
C                      C#dim
Buzz all around like a bee
G                                   E7
Shake it around like a ship on the sea
      A7             
that wild rag that crazy rag
        D7                   G
Better known as the Georgia rag

Come all the way from Paris France
Come to Atlanta to get a chance
To do that rag, that Georgia rag

Grab your mama and hold her tight
let's mess around the rest of the night
doin that rag that Georgia rag

>Chorus

Rustle your hands way up high
grab your daddy and make him cry
doing that rag, that Georgia rag

People come from miles around
Get on Darktown to break'em on down
doing that rag, that Georgia rag

>Chorus

Down in Darktown night and day
try to dance them blues away
doing that rag, that Georgia rag

Going all the way back to Newport News
singing the doggone Atlanta blues
bout that rag - that Georgia rag

>Chorus
