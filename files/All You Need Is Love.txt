G                       D/F#             Em
There's nothing you can do that can't be done

G                      D/F#               Em
Theres nothing you can sing that can't be sung

D7/A            G               D/F#              D7      
Nothing you can say but you can learn to play the game

D7/A    D7
It's    easy


There's nothing you can make that can't be made
No one  you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do but you can learn how to be you in time
It's easy


CHORUS:

G       A7sus   D7
All you need is love

G       A7sus   D7
All you need is love

G       B7      Em         G/D 
All you need is love       love

C       D7      G
Love is all you need


There's nothing you can know that isn't known
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
Nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be
Its easy

CHORUS

C       D7      G
Love is all you need   

G       A7sus   D7
All you need is love

D7                 G       A7sus   D7
All together now   All you need is love

D7              G       A7sus   D7
Everybody now   All you need is love 

G       D       G  
Love is all you need   (repeats a few times)

(Then Paul (I think) starts going "Oh yeah  - loves you yeah yeah 
yeah  - she loves you yeah yeah yeah").
