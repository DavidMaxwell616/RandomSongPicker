SINGING THE BLUES
Recorded by Gail Davies
Written by Melvin Endsley

[C] Well, I never felt more like [F] singin' the blues
'Cause [C] I never thought that [G] I'd ever lose
Your [C] love [F] dear, [G] why'd you do me this [C] way
Well, I never felt more like [F] cryin' all night
'Cause [C] everything's wrong, there [G] ain't nothin' right
With-[C] out [F] you, [G] you got me singin' the [C] blues.

Now the [F] moon and stars [C] no longer shine
The [F] dream is gone I [C] thought was mine
There's [F] nothin' left for [C] me to do
But Cry-y-y over [G] you (cry over you)
Well, [C] I never felt more like [F] runnin' away
But [C] how can I go when [G] I couldn't stay
With-[C] out [F] you, [G] you got me singin' the [C] blues.

(Slightly different words in 2nd chorus)
WELL, the moon and stars no longer shine
AND the dream is gone THAT I thought was mine
There's nothin' left for me to do
But CRY, CRY, CRY, CRY over [G] you (cry over you)
Well, I never felt more like runnin' away
But how can I go when I couldn't stay
Without you, you got me singin' the blues.

Without you, you got me singin' the blues.
