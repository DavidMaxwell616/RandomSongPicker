The Morning After

D# F

 A#                          F
There's got to be a morning after
Gm         F         D#
if we can hold on through the night
Edim          F                Gm
We have the chance to find the sunshine,
  D#            G#              F
let's keep on looking for the light.
 
Oh, can't you see the morning after?
It's waiting right outside the storm
Why don't we cross the bridge together,
and find a place that's safe and warm.
 
It's not too late, we should be giving
Only with love can we climb
It's not too late, not while we're living
Let's put our hands out in time.
 
There's got to be a morning after.
We're moving closer to the shore.
I know we'll be there by tomorrow
and we'll escape the darkness,
we won't be searching anymore.
 
There's got to be a morning after (repeat and fade)
