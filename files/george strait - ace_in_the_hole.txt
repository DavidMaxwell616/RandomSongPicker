Ace In The Hole
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
as performed by George Strait
 
capo the first fret

A
You've got to have an ace in the hole
         D7                 A     A7
A little secret that nobody knows
D         D#dim7    A/E                  F#7
Life is a gamble, a game we all          play
		B7                           E        E7
But you need to save something for a rainy day
       A
You've got to learn to play your card right
   D7                   A    A7
If you expect to win in life
      D          D#dim7      A/E          F#7
Don't put it all on the line for just one roll
       B7             E7         A
You've got to have an ace in the hole

2: If you're headed down a one way street
   And you're not sure it's the way you wanna go
   In money or love or all the above
   Have a little more than what you show
   When life deals out a surprise
   Have a few surprises of your own
   No matter what you do, no matter where you go
   You've got to have an ace in the hole
