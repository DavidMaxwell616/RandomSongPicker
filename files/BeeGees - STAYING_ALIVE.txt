Subject: TAB: Staying Alive - Bee Gees

Here is the tab to "Stayin' Alive."  The song is in the key of A flat, 
but all the Ds are played as natural instead of flattened.  I have put
the chords under the tab charts instead of over the lyrics.  The chord
changes appear to be few and far between; that is just because of the
fast 4/4 tempo.

By the way, could someone please, please, please post the tab to "Don't
Stand So Close to Me" by the Police?

Exceed your disk quo, 
Proceed to disco.      :)

                          "Stayin' Alive"

Well you can tell by the way I use my walk, 
I'm a woman's man; no time to talk
I get low and I get high, and if I cant get either i real-ly try.
Got the music loud and women warm, I've been kicked around since I was born.
wings of heaven  on my shoes, I'm a dancin man and  I just cant lose
And now  it's  all right, it's o  k. And   you may look the other way.
You know it's  all right, it's o  k. I'll  live to see  an- other day.
We can try to understand the  New York Times' ef-fect on man.
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother, 
you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive. 

Repeat the the above 2 lines (starting with "whether..." with these words:
Feel the city breakin' and ev'rybody shakin', 
and we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive. 
Ah ha ha ha  stayin' alive, stayin' alive  Ah ha ha ha 
stayin' alive_..............................
well now Life goin' no where
Somebody help me....                    Somebody help me,    yeah.
Life goin' no where Somebody help me, yeah
Stayin' alive...................
repeat and fade.
