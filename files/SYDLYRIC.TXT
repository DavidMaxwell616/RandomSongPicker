SYD SOLO SONGS

FROM THE ALBUM "Barrett"

BABY LEMONADE
 
In the sad town
cold iron hands clap
the party of clowns outside
rain falls in gray far away
please, please, Baby Lemonade

In the evening sun going down
when the earth streams in, in the morning
send a cage through the post
make your name like a ghost
please, please, Baby Lemonade

I'm screaming, I met you this way
you're nice to me like ice
in the clock they sent through a washing machine
come around, make it soon, so alone...
please, please, Baby Lemonade

In the sad town
cold iron hands clap
the party of clowns outside
rain falls in gray far away
please, please, Baby Lemonade

In the evening sun going down
when the earth streams in, in the morning
send a cage through the post
make your name like a ghost
please, please, Baby Lemonade



LOVE SONG 

I knew a girl and I like her still
she said she knew she would trust me
and I her will...
I said: OK baby, tell me what you'll be
and I'll lay my head down and see what I see.
By the time she was back
by her open eyes
I knew that I was in for a big surprise.

I knew a girl and I like her still
she said she knew she would trust me
and I her will...
I said: OK baby, tell me what you'll be
and I'll lay my head down and see what I see.
By the time she was back
by her open eyes
I knew that I was in for a big surprise.



DOMINOES

It's an idea, someday
in my tears, my dreams
don't you want to see her proof?
Life that comes of no harm
you and I, you and I and dominoes, the day goes by...

You and I in place
wasting time on dominoes
a day so dark, so warm
life that comes of no harm
you and I and dominoes, time goes by...

Fireworks and heat, someday
hold a shell, a stick or play
overheard a lark today
losing when my mind's astray
don't you want to know with your pretty hair
stretch your hand, glad feel,
in an echo for your way.

It's an idea, someday...

It's an idea, someday
in my tears, my dreams
don't you want to see her proof?
Life that comes of no harm
you and I, you and I and dominoes, the day goes by...



IT IS OBVIOUS 

It is obvious
may I say, oh baby, that it is found on another plane?
Yes I can creep into cupboards, sleep in the hall
your stars - my stars, a simple cock bar
only an impulse - pie in the sky
mumble listen dolly
drift over your mind - holly
creep into bed when your head's on the ground
she held the torch on the porch,
she winked an eye

Reason it is written on the brambles
stranded on the spikes - my blood red, oh listen:
remember those times I could call
through the clear day
time - be there...
braver and braver, a handkerchief waver
the louder you lips to a loud hailer
growing together, they ('re) growing each either
no wondering, stumbling, fumbling
rumbling minds shot together,
our minds shot together...

So equally over a valley, a hill
wood on quarry stood, each of us crying
a velvet curtain of gray
mark the blanket where the sparrows play
and the trees by the waving corn stranded
my legs move the last empty inches to you
the softness, the warmth from the weather in suspense
mote to a grog - the star a white chalk
minds shot together, our minds shot together...



RATS 

Got it hit down
spot knock inside a spider
says: "That's love yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!"
"That's love yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!"
says: "That's love - All know it
TV, teeth, feet, peace, feel it...
"That's love yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!"
"That's love yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!"

like the fall that brings me to
I like the fall that brings me to
I like the cord around sinew
I make a cord around sinew

Duck, the way to least is less
Tea craving of the metal west
'ell tomorrow's rain and test
'ell tomorrow's rain and test
Love an empty son and guess
Love an empty son and guess
pimples dangerous and blessed

Heaving, arriving, tinkling
mingling jets and statuettes
seething wet we meeting fleck
seething wet we meeting fleck
lines and winds and crib and half
each fair day I give you half
of each fair day I give you half
I look into your eyes and you,
flathe in the sun for you...

Bam, spastic, tactile engine
heaving, crackle, slinky, dormy, roofy, wham
I'll have them, fried bloke
broken jardy, cardy, smoocho, moocho, paki, pufftle
sploshette moxy, very smelly,
cable, gable, splintra, channel
top the seam he's taken off

rats, rats lay down flat
we don't need you, we act like that
and if you think you're un-loved
then we know about that...
rats, rats, lay down flat!
yes, yes, yes, yes, lay down flat!



MASIE 

Maisie, Maisie, Maisie, Maisie...
bad luck, bride of a bull
strode out to meet Maisie in the evening light
Maisie, his illuminous grin put her in a spin
Maisie, lay in the hall
with diamonds and emeralds
Maisie, Maisie...
bad luck - the bride of a bull

Maisie lay in the wall with her emeralds
and diamond brooch, beyond reproach
bad luck - bride of a bull
strode out to meet Maisie in the evening light...
Maisie!




GIGOLO  AUNT

Grooving around in a trench coat
with the satin on trail
Seems to be all around in tin and lead pail, we pale
Jiving on down to the beach
to see the blue and the gray
seems to be all and it's rosy-it's a beautiful day!

Will you please keep on the track
'cause I almost want you back
'cause I know what you are
you are a gigolo aunt, you're a gigolo aunt!
Yes I know what you are
you are a gigolo aunt, you're a gigolo aunt!

Heading down with the light, the dust in your way
she was angrier than, than her watershell male
life to this love to me - heading me down to me
thunderbird shale
seems to be all and it's rosy - it's a beautiful day!
will you please keep on the track
'cause I almost want you back
'cause I know what you are
you are a gigolo aunt

Grooving on down in a knapsack superlative day
some wish she move and just as she can move jiving away
she made the scene should have been-superlative day
everything's all and it's rosy, it's a beautiful day
will you please keep on the track
'cause I almost want you back
'cause I know what you are
you are a gigolo aunt...



 WAVING MY ARMS IN THE AIR/
 NEVER LIED TO YOU
 	(continuous)

Waving my arms in the air
love, my love, got no care
no care, no, no, pressing my feet to the ground
stand up right where you stand
call to you and what do you do
laying back in a chair?
she's so high on the air
she's so high on the air
half and half, half and half
all you have to do to call
is hold her hand, stand a while
and then smile and we'll understand
yes we do - yes, yes we do!
Oh what a girl I've got too!
Oh what a girl I've got too!
with her slinky look she held her tie to her hair
(and I) could see everywhere
no-one in the land, no-one
no-one in the land, no-one
but it rains on Saturday - cats and dogs in the way
stormy day, hey, hey
and you shouldn't try to be
what you can't be
and you shouldn't try to be
what you can't be
call to you and what do you do

There will be shoulders pressing in the hall
and I won't know if you're here at all
there will be wine and drinking in the yard
there won't be anybody very hard
there will be lots of things that we can do
and all and more will be for you
everything I knew I tried with you
but everything to you was never easy
so I went ahead around my world
I saw the things you do arriving by your side
to see you looking too
but I know this. I know, I never lied to you
it's been just like you're gone
for just one day for so long!
It's been so hard to bear with you not there
but though I think of you, the things you do
when I'm with you, to be with you,
to be alone...can only think:
"Why I am here? What's meant to be?"



WINED AND DINED 

Wined and dined, oh it seemed just like a dream!
Girl was so kind.
kind of love I'd never seen
only last summer, it's not so long ago...
just last summer, now musk winds blow...

Wined and dined, oh it seemed just like a dream!
Girl was so kind.
kind of love I'd never seen
only last summer, it's not so long ago...
just last summer, now musk winds blow...

Chalk underfoot, life I should prove
dancing in heat, our love and you...

Wined and dined, oh it seemed just like a dream!
Girl was so kind.
kind of love I'd never seen
only last summer, it's not so long ago...
just last summer, now musk winds blow...



WOLFPACK 

Howling the pack in formation appears
diamonds and clubs, light misted fog, the dead
waving us back in formation,
the pack in formation
bowling they bat as a group
and the leader is seen - so early...
the pack on their backs, the fighters
through misty the waving - the pack in formation
far reaching waves
on sight, shone right
I lay as if in surround...
all enmeshing, hovering...
the milder I gaze
all the animals laying trail
beyond the bough winds
mild the reflecting electricity eyes...
tears, the life that was ours
grows sharper and stronger away and beyond
short wheeling - fresh spring
gripped with blanched bones - moaned
magnesium, proverbs and sobs...
howling the pack in formation appears
diamonds and clubs, light misted fog, the dead
waving us back in formation,
the pack in formation...



EFFERVESCING ELEPHANT

An Effervescing Elephant
with tiny eyes and great big trunk
once whispered to the tiny ear
the ear of one inferior
that by next June he'd die, oh yeah!
because the tiger would roam.
The little one said: "Oh my goodness I must stay at home!
and every time I hear a growl
I'll know the tiger's on the prowl
and I'll be really safe, you know
the elephant he told me so."
Everyone was nervy, oh yeah!
and the message was spread
to zebra, mongoose, and the dirty hippopotamus
who wallowed in the mud and chewed
his spicy hippo-plankton food
and tended to ignore the word
preferring to survey a herd
of stupid water bison, oh yeah!
And all the jungle took fright,
and ran around for all the day and the night
but all in vain, because, you see,
the tiger came and said: "Who me?!
You know, I wouldn't hurt not one of you.
I'd much prefer something to chew
and you're all to scant." oh yeah!
He ate the Elephant


FROM THE ALBUM "The Madcap Laughs"

TERRAPIN 

I really love you and I mean you
the star above you, crystal blue
Well, oh baby, my hairs on end about you...

I wouldn't see you and I love to
I fly above you, yes I do
well, oh baby, my hairs on end about you...

Floating, bumping, noses dodge a tooth
the fins a luminous 
fangs all 'round the clown
is dark below the boulders hiding all
the sunlight's good for us
'Cause we're the fishes and all we do
the move about is all we do
well, oh baby, my hairs on end about you...

Floating, bumping, noses dodge a tooth
the fins a luminous 
fangs all 'round the clown
is dark below the boulders hiding all
the sunlight's good for us
'Cause we're the fishes and all we do
the move about is all we do
well, oh baby, my hairs on end about you...

I really love you and I mean you
the star above you, crystal blue
Well, oh baby, my hairs on end about you...



NO GOOD TRYING 

It's no good trying to place your hand
where I can't see because I understand
that you're different from me
yes I can tell
that you can't be what you pretend
and you're rocking me backwards
and you're rocking towards the
red and yellow mane of a stallion horse.

It's no good trying to hold your love
where I can't see because I understand
that you're different from me
yes I can tell
that you can't be what you pretend
the caterpillar hood won't cover the head of you
know you should be home in bed.

It's no good holding your sequin fan
where I can't see because I understand
that you're different from me
yes I can tell
that you can't be what you pretend
yes you're spinning around and around in a car
with electric lights flashing very fast...



LOVE YOU 

Honey love you, honey little,
honey funny sunny morning
love you more funny love in the skyline baby
ice-cream 'scuse me,
I've seen you looking good the other evening

Oh, you dig it, had to smile just an hour or so
(are) we in love like I think we be?
It ain't a long rhyme.
It took ages to think
I think I'll hurl it in the water, baby...

Honey love you, honey little,
honey funny sunny morning
love you more funny love in the skyline baby
ice-cream 'scuse me,
I've seen you looking good the other evening

Thinking you are an nice little one
to put it all around, its just good
I like it, hey hey hey
Spend some time that day
whoopee! swinging along over across to me

Honey love you, honey little,
honey funny sunny morning
love you more funny love in the skyline baby
ice-cream 'scuse me,
I've seen you looking good the other evening

Goodtime rocker woman we'll stray our pieces
little creepy we shine so sleepy,
so whoopee!
That's how you look...

Honey love you, honey little,
honey funny sunny morning
love you more funny love in the skyline baby
ice-cream 'scuse me,
I've seen you looking good the other evening


NO MAN'S LAND 

You would hold your head up high
you even try
you would hold another hand:
oh understand!
They even see me under call
we under all,
we awful, awful, crawl
to hear my hour
come see me cry...

Just searching you even try
I can make you smile
if it's there will you go there too?
When I live I die!
They even see me under call
we under all, we awful, awful, crawl
because of you, to see me be.

(last verse mostly garbled....but you can pick out Tell me, Tell
me, Tell me  Yippee  and also: Heavily Spaced.  According to
legend, this verse was originally meant to be understood, but
when they f**ked it up in the studio, Syd liked it and kept it
that way...) - Psycho



DARK GLOBE

Oh where are you now
pussy willow that smiled on this leaf?
When I was alone you promised the stone from your heart
my head kissed the ground
I was half the way down, treading the sand
please, please, lift a hand
I'm only a person whose armbands beat
on his hands, hang tall
won't you miss me?
Wouldn't you miss me at all?

The poppy birds way
swing twigs coffee brands around
brandish her wand with a feathery tongue
my head kissed the ground
I was half the way down, treading the sand
please, please, please lift the hand
I'm only a person with Eskimo chain
I tattooed my brain all the way...
Won't you miss me?
Wouldn't you miss me at all?



HERE I GO

This is a story 'bout a girl that I knew
she didn't like my songs
and that made me feel blue
she said: "a big band is far better than you"...

She don't rock 'n' roll, she don't like it
she don't do the stroll, well she don't do it right
well, ev'rythings wrong and my patience was gone
when I woke one morning
and remembered this song
O-oh-oh, kinda catchy, I hoped
that she would talk to me now
and even allow me to hold her hand
and forget that old band.

I strolled around to her pad
her light was off and that's bad
her sister said that my girl was gone
"But come inside, boy, and play, play, play me a song!"
I said "Yeah! Here I go"
She's kinda cute; don't you know,
That after a while of seeing her smile
I knew we could make it, make it in style!?

So now I've got all I need
She and I are in love, we've agreed
she likes this song and my others too
so now you see my world is...
because of this tune!
What a boon this tune!
I tell you soon
We'll be lying in bed, happily wed,
and I won't think of that girl
or what she said...



OCTOPUS

Trip to heave and ho, up down, to and fro'
you have no word
trip, trip to a dream dragon
hide your wings in a ghost tower
sails cackling at every plate we break
cracked by scattered needles
the little minute gong
coughs and clears his throat
madam you see before you stand
hey ho, never be still
the old original favorite grand
grasshoppers green Herbarian band
and the tune they play is "In Us Confide"
so trip to heave and ho, up down, to and fro'
you have no word
Please leave us here
close our eyes to the octopus ride!
Isn't it good to be lost in the wood
isn't it bad so quiet there, in the wood
meant even less to me than I thought
with a honey plough of yellow prickly seeds
clover honey pots and mystic shining feed...
well, the madcap laughed at the man on the border
hey ho, huff the Talbot
"Cheat" he cried shouting kangaroo
it's true in their tree they cried
Please leave us here
close our eyes to the octopus ride!
The madcap laughed at the man on the border
hey ho, huff the Talbot
the winds they blew and the leaves did wag
they'll never put me in their bag
the seas will reach and always seep
so high you go, so low you creep
the wind it blows in tropical heat
the drones they throng on mossy seats
the squeaking door will always squeak
two up, two down we'll never meet
so merrily trip forgo my side
Please leave us here
close our eyes to the octopus ride!



GOLDEN HAIR
(These lyrics are originally from "Chamber Music" by James Joyce (1907) 
 
Lean out your window, golden hair
I heard you singing in the midnight air
my book is closed, I read no more
watching the fire dance, on the floor
I've left my book, I've left my room

For I heard you singing through the gloom
singing and singing, a merry air
lean out the window, golden hair...



LONG GONE

She was long gone, long, long gone
she was gone, gone, the bigger they come
the larger her hand 'till no one understands
why for so long she'd been gone.

And I stood very still by the window sill
and I wondered for those I love still
I cried in my mind where I stand behind
the beauty of love's in her eyes...

She was long gone, long, long gone
she was gone, gone, the bigger they come
the larger her hand 'till no one understands
why for so long she'd been gone.

And I borrowed the page
from a leopard's cage
and I prowled in the evening sun's glaze
her head lifted high to the light in the sky
the opening dawn on her face...

She was long gone long, long gone
she was gone, gone, the bigger they come
the larger her hand 'till no one understands
why for so long she'd been gone.

And I stood very still by the window sill
and I wondered for those I love still
I cried in my mind where I stand behind
the beauty of love's in her eyes...

She was long gone, long, long gone
she was gone, gone, the bigger they come
the larger her hand 'till no one understands
why for so long she'd been gone.

She was long gone long, long gone.



SHE TOOK A LONG COLD LOOK
 
She took a long cold look at me
and smiled and gazed all over my arm
she loves to see me get down to ground
she hasn't time just to be with me
her face between all she means to be
to be extreme, just to be extreme
a broken pier on the wavy sea
she wonders why for all she wants to see...
But I got up and I stomped around
and hid the piece where the trees touch the ground...

The end of truth that lay out the time
spent lazing here on a painting dream
a mile or more in a foreign clime
to see farther inside of me.

And looking high up into the sky
I breathe as the water streams over me...



FEEL

You feel me
away far too empty, oh so alone!
I want to go home
Oh find me inside of a nocturne - the blonde
how I love you to be by my side
they wail...
the crowd on her side
she straggled the bridge by the water...

She misses her crawl
far ley grew
heady aside in a dell
inside an eye be the lonely one, my bride
how I leave on the waddling wheel
they flail...
a gasp shringing
a bad bell's ringing
the angel - the daughter...

You feel me...



IF IT'S IN YOU 

Yes I'm thinking of this, yes I am
puddle town, Tom was the underground
hold you tighter so close, yes you are
please hold on to the steel rail

colonel with gloves
he isn't loved on 'Sundays Mail'
all the fives crock Henrietta
she's mean go-getter
gotta write her a letter.

Did I wink of this, I am
yum, yummy, yum, don't, yummy, yum, yom, yom...
Yes, I'm thinking of this, in steam
skeleton kissed to the steel rail

fleas in Pamela
chugging along with a funnel of steam
all the fives crock Henrietta
she's mean go-getter
gotta write her a letter...



LATE NIGHT

When I woke up today
and you weren't there to play
then I wanted to be with you
when you showed me your eyes
whispered love at the skies
then I wanted to stay with you
inside me I feel alone and unreal
and the way you kiss will always be
a very special thing to me...

When I lay still at night seeing
stars high and light
then I wanted to be with you
when the rooftops shone dark
all alone (I) saw a spark
spark of love just to stay with you
inside me I feel alone and unreal
and the way you kiss will always be
a very special thing to me...

If I mention your name
turn around on a chain
then the sky opens for you
when we grew very tall
when I saw you so small
then I wanted to stay with you
inside me I feel alone and unreal
and the way you kiss will always be
a very special thing to me...


FROM THE ALBUM "Opel"

OPEL 

On a distant shore, miles from land
stands the ebony totem in ebony sand
a dream in a mist of gray...
on a far distant shore...

The pebble that stood alone
and driftwood lies half buried
warm shallow waters sweep shells
so the cockles shine...

A bare winding carcass, stark
shimmers as flies scoop up meat, an empty way...
dry tears...
crisp flax squeaks tall reeds
make a circle of gray in a summer way, around man
stood on ground...

I'm trying
I'm trying to find you!
To find you
I'm living, I'm giving,
To find you, To find you,
I'm living, I'm living,
I'm trying, I'm giving

SWAN LEE (SILAS LANG)

Swan Lee got up at the Running Foot pow-wow,
heading from the fire to his waiting canoe.
Chattering Squaw untied the wigwam door,
the chief blew smoke rings two by two!

The land in silence stands...

Swan Lee, his boat by the bank in the darkness,
loosened the rope in the creek is entwined.
A feather from the wing of a wild young eagle,
pointed to the land where his fortune he'd find

The land in silence stands

Swan Lee paddled on from the land of his fathers,
his eyes scanned the undergrowth on either side.
From the shore hung a hot, heavy, creature infested
tropic, Swan Lee had a bow by his side

The land in silence stands

Swan Lee kept time, half on land, half on water,
Grizzly bear and raccoon his fare.
He followed his ears to the great water fall,
Swan Lee knew deep down that his squaw  was there!

The land in silence stands....

Suddenly the rush of the mighty great thunder,
confronted Swan Lee as his song he sang,
In the dawn, with his squaw, he was battling homewards
It was all written down by Long Silas Lang.

The land in silence stands...
The land in silence stands...
The land in silence stands.


BIRDIE HOP

Birdie Hop - he do, he hop along
a lonely bird upon a window there
he, he, there he blow
a windy snow, he knew the snow,
I know the snow, a hoppy bird

The antelope ride around the parasol
just to see if he's a man
enough to meet you in the sandpit
on a flying kind of sign in a meddlesome way
you know the way - I see the flies
she's a little kite the sort
you think you might like to fly
and like a kite you get to see her
every night, you know the way
she's only paving her way -
hectochrome plane - I see the flies.

Birdie Hop - he do, he hop along
a lonely bird upon a window there
he, he, there he blow
a windy snow, he knew the snow,
I know the snow, a hoppy bird

A camel woke up to a polish dawn
wouldn't look to see his feet had gone
he wouldn't like it
wouldn't have the strength to fight it,
I see the flies
I'm the only bird, a little third,
I lost a quarter
had a yearning to be earning just a dollar a day
in a way you shouldn't like it, hectochrome plane
I see the flies.


LET'S SPLIT

Everything about,
about to go out,
me out, you out,
yes and everything is out
about, out...
out, out, out, out, out, out,
Let's split!
I'm telling you this is it!

Everything is down,
and hound, hound, hound
back down, down, down
even everything is down
abound and down,
down, down, down, down, down, down
Let's split!
Tellin' you this is it!

Nobody is right tonight,
night, height, right, tight,
it isn't right
Me out, you out 
And everything is out
out, out, out, out, out, out
Let's split!

<Hold it, can you?>
<That's all - just.>



WOULDN'T YOU MISS ME (DARK GLOBE)

(see "The Madcap Laughs")


MILKY WAY

What'd you ever say today when you're in the milky way

oh tell me please
if I met you - I told you what to do
seems a while
since I could smile the way you do...

how many times, if I try, if I may,
when you're in the milky way

half of your time -beside me only atmosphere
since I could smile the way you do...

What can anyone mean to you
standing in the milky way

take life easy
Why so empty...?
I told you - I can tell you
what to do - when I hold you
and I tell you "I love you"
I feel that I'm way you do...

Give a grasp of life today
when you're in the milky way
oh, try to please! Knock on wood of the trees
glad you, mold you, mold you and hold you
means five miles
and everyway for you...


BOB DYLAN BLUES
(unreleased)

I've got the Bob Dylan Blues
I've got the Bob Dylan Blues
My hair and my hat's in a messa
But I don't give a damn about that!


ROOFTOP IN A THUNDERSTORM ROW MISSING THE POINT
(unreleased)
 
With yellow, red and roomy food, and quivered
crouching on a golden cushion
undressed himself to disappear
through an infinity of pleasure
and smiled to free the running me
with "Am I my brother's keeper?"
his meek hand on devils gloves
shaping running blood.

The prophecy, to ricreate the truth
in visions of a seasonal mood
in truth, the only sight he saw
lay hidden in the bathroom door
and spat on the rug
as high is high, so low is low
and that's the end of it.



TWO OF A KIND 
(on Peel Sessions)

Open your eyes and don't be blind
can't you see we're two of a kind?
I've got to say this, I hope you don't mind
I love you, we're two of a kind

Just ask yourself and you will find
we go together, we're two of a kind
no use protesting, be resigned
baby you know, we're two of a kind

I knew it when I saw you
I felt it a little more when
I talked with you at first
all my blues dispersed
I couldn't disguise
my complete surprise
when you were feeling it too
I'm in love with you, I'm in love with you...

Open your eyes and don't be blind
can't you see we're two of a kind?
I've got to say this, I hope you don't mind
I love you, we're two of a kind




SYD'S PINK FLOYD SONGS


FROM THE ALBUM "Piper at the Gates of 
Dawn"

ASTRONOMY DOMINE

Lime and limpid green, a second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew.
Floating down, the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground.
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania.
Neptune, Titan, Stars can frighten.

Blinding signs flap
Flicker, flicker, flicker blam. Pow, pow.
Stairway scared and death rules there 
Lime and limpid green, the sounds around the icy waters under
Lime and limpid green, the sounds around the icy waters underground.


LUCIFER SAM

Lucifer Sam, Siam cat.
Always sitting by your side
Always by your side.
That cat's something I can't explain.

Jennifer Gentle you're a witch.
You're the left side
He's the right side.
Oh, no!
That cat's something I can't explain.

Lucifer go to sea.
Be a hip cat, be a ship's cat.
Somewhere, anywhere.
That cat's something I can't explain.

At night prowling sifting sand.
Hiding around on the ground.
He'll be found when you're around.
That cat's something I can't explain.



MATILDA MOTHER

There was a king who ruled the land.
His majesty was in command.
With silver eyes the scarlet eagle
Showers silver on the people.
Oh Mother, tell me more.

Why'd'ya have to leave me there
Hanging in my infant air waiting?
You only have to read the lines
They're scribbly black and everything shines.

Across the stream with wooden shoes
With bells to tell the king the news
A thousand misty riders climb up
Higher once upon a time.
Wandering and dreaming
The words have different meaning.
Yes they did.

For all the time spent in that room
The doll's house, darkness, old perfume
And fairy stories held me high on
Clouds of sunlight floating by.
Oh Mother, tell me more
Tell me more.



FLAMING 

Alone in the clouds all blue
Lying on an eiderdown.
Yippee! You can't see me
But I can you.

Lazing in the foggy dew
Sitting on a unicorn.
No fair, you can't hear me
But I can you.

Watching buttercups cup the light
Sleeping on a dandelion.
Too much, I won't touch you
But then I might.

Screaming through the starlit sky
Traveling by telephone.
Hey ho, here we go
Ever so high.

Alone in the clouds all blue
Lying on an eiderdown.
Yippee! You can't see me
But I can you.



THE GNOME

I want to tell you a story
About a little man
If I can.
A gnome named Grimble Grumble.
And little gnomes stay in their homes.
Eating, sleeping, drinking their wine.

He wore a scarlet tunic,
A blue green hood,
It looked quite good.
He had a big adventure
Amidst the grass
Fresh air at last.

Wining, dining, biding his time.
And then one day - hooray!
Another way for gnomes to say
Hoooooooooray.

Look at the sky, look at the river
Isn't it good?
Look at the sky, look at the river
Isn't it good?
Winding, finding places to go.
And then one day - hooray!
Another way for gnomes to say
Hoooooooooray.
Hooooooooooooooray.



CHAPTER 24

A movement is accomplished in six stages
And the seventh brings return.
The seven is the number of the young light
It forms when darkness is increased by one.
Change returns success
Going and coming without error.
Action brings good fortune.
Sunset.

The time is with the month of winter solstice
When the change is due to come.
Thunder in the other course of heaven.
Things cannot be destroyed once and for all.
Change returns success
Going and coming without error.
Action brings good fortune.
Sunset, sunrise.

A movement is accomplished in six stages
And the seventh brings return.
The seven is the number of the young light
It forms when darkness is increased by one.
Change returns success
Going and coming without error.
Action brings good fortune.
Sunset, sunrise.



THE SCARECROW

The black and green scarecrow as everyone knows
Stood with a bird on his hat and straw everywhere.
He didn't care.
He stood in a field where barley grows.

His head did no thinking
His arms didn't move except then the wind cut up
Rough and mice ran around on the ground
He stood in a field where barley grows.

The black and green scarecrow is sadder than me
But now he's resigned to his fate
'Cause life's not unkind - he doesn't mind.
He stood in a field where barley grows.



BIKE

I've got a bike. You can ride it if you like.
It's got a basket, a bell that rings and things to make it look good.
I'd give it to you if I could, but I borrowed it.

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.
I'll give you anything, everything if you want things.

I've got a cloak. It's a bit of a joke.
There's a tear up the front. It's red and black, I've had it for months.
If you think it could look good, then I guess it should.

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.
I'll give you anything, everything if you want things.

I know a mouse, and he hasn't got a house.
I don't know why. I call him Gerald.
He's getting rather old, but he's a good mouse.

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.
I'll give you anything, everything if you want things.

I've got a clan of gingerbread men.
Here a man, there a man, lots of gingerbread men.
Take a couple if you wish. They're on the dish.

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.
I'll give you anything, everything if you want things.

I know a room of musical tunes.
Some rhyme, some ching. Most of them are clockwork.
Let's go into the other room and make them work.


JUGBAND BLUES
(from the album "Saucerful of Secrets")

It's awfully considerate of you to think of me here
And I'm much obliged to you for making it clear
That I'm not here.
And I never knew the moon could be so big
And I never knew the moon could be so blue
And I'm grateful that you threw away my old shoes
And brought me here instead dressed in red
And I'm wondering who could be writing this song.

I don't care if the sun don't shine
And I don't care if nothing is mine
And I don't care if I'm nervous with you
I'll do my loving in the winter.

And the sea isn't green
And I love the queen
And what exactly is a dream
And what exactly is a joke.


ARNOLD LAYNE
(single)

Arnold Layne had a strange hobby
Collecting clothes
Moonshine, washing line
They suit him fine
On the wall, hung a tall mirror
Distorted view, see through baby blue
Oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same, takes two to know
Two to know, two to know -
Why can't you see?
Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne

Now he's caught - a nasty sort of person.
They gave him time
Doors clang - chain gang - he hates it
Oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same, takes two to know
Two to know, two to know
Why can't you see?
Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne

Don't do it again


CANDY AND A CURRANT BUN (LET'S ROLL ANOTHER ONE)
(single)

Oh my, girl sitting in the sun
Go buy, candy and a currant bun
I like, to see you run
lay back......

Oooh, don't talk to me
Please, just fuck with me
Please, you know I'm feeling frail

It's true, sun shining very bright
It's you, I'm gonna love tonight
Ice cream, tastes good in the afternoon
Ice cream, tastes good if you eat it soon

Oooh, don't touch me child
Please you know you drive me wild
Please you know I'm feeling frail

Don't try another cat
Don't go where other -
you must know why
I'm very very very frail


Oh my, girl sitting in the sun
Go buy, candy and a currant bun
I like, to see you run
Lay back......


APPLES AND ORANGES 
(single)

Got a flip-top pack of cigarettes in her pocket
Feeling good at the top
Shopping in sharp shoes
Walking in the sunshine town -
feeling very cool
But the butchers and the bakers in the supermarket stores
Getting everything she wants from the supermarket stores
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges

Cornering neatly she trips up sweetly
To meet the people
She's on time again
And then
I catch her by the eye 
then I stop and have to think
What a funny thing to do 'cause I'm feeling very pink
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges

I love she
She loves me
See you

See you

Thought you might like to know
I'm the lorry driver man
She's on the run
Down by the river side
feeding ducks by the afternoon tide
(quack quack)
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges


SCREAM THY LAST SCREAM
(unreleased)

Scream thy last scream, old woman with a casket,
Blam, blam, your pointers, point your pointers,
Wattle with apples to granchy Mrs. Stores,
She'll be scrubbing buffles on all fours,
Scream thy last scream, old woman with a casket,

Fling your arms madly, old lady with a daughter,
Flat top supposes, Moses, hoses,
Hiddle and Diddle are sitting back
Watching the telly for all hours,
(Telly time)
Fling your arms madly, old lady with a daughter,

Scream thy last scream, old woman with a casket,
Blam, blam, your pointers, point your pointers,
Wattle with apples to granchy Mrs. Stores,
She'll be scrubbing buffles on all fours,
Scream thy last scream, old woman with a casket,



VEGETABLE MAN
(unreleased)

In yellow shoes 
I get the blues,
So I walk the street with my plastic feet
with blue velvet trousers make me feel pink.
Theres a kind of stink about blue velvet trousers

In my paisley shirt,
I look a jerk,
and my turquoise wasitcoat is quite outta sight.
But oh, oh, my haircut looks so bad....
Vegetable man! Where are you?

So I change my gear,
and I bugger my knees
and I cover them up with the latest cuts
My pants and socks are all in a box
It does take long to find darn old socks
The watch, 
black watch, 
my watch 
with a black face
and a date in a little hole

and all the luck,
its what I got,
Its what I wear,
Its what you see,
It must be me,
Its what I am!
Vegetable man! Where are you?

Ah, ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Hah, ah ah ah, ah ah ah - oh!
I've been looking all over the place
for a place for me
But it ain't anywhere
It just ain't anywhere.

Vegetable man, Vegetable man,
Vegetable man. Vegetable man,
Vegetable man, Vegetable man,

He's the kind of fella you just gotta see if you can,
Vegetable man.




SEE EMILY PLAY
(Single)

Emily tries but misunderstands, ah ooh
She often inclined to borrow somebody's dreams till tomorrow
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for may
See Emily play
Soon after dark Emily cries, ah ooh
Gazing through trees in sorrow hardly a sound till tomorrow
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for may
See Emily play
Put on a gown that touches the ground, ah ooh
Float on a river forever and ever, Emily
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for may
See Emily play
