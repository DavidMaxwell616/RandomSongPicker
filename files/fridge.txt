FRIDGE OF BECKS BLUES - VALIUM EFFORT

A A/G F D7/F#

Well I'm just a warm Miller in a fridge of cold Becks 
I can't get no sleep and I can't get no sex
I'm just a toss or few short of a nut
If I was a child photographer my name would be Helmut

      C                      D               Dm7    
      Nobody drinks you in a fridge of Becks blues 
      G                        G#dim            A
      Schwag to the kind, your seeds no one can use

I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer
If it wasn't for my percocets, I'd be completely ignored
I'm not the highest proof of Bourbon on the shelf
I tried to have a party, wound up raging with myself

>chorus

Pet Shop Boys wouldn't have me 
G#m
McDonalds' not hirin' (or so they say) 
F#m
Guess I'll put on my Sunday's best 
    B7                      E      E7 
and scare some of the girls away.

I'm not a girl's logical choice for an affair
I only stand a chance when the girl's unaware
I'm not the highest bias tape in the case
My flesh with vibrating plastic you could easily replace

>Chorus

I'm not the quickest seagull on the beach 
I'd drink top shelf Bourbon but I'm too dumb to reach 
I'm just a couple a cards short of a deck
Only had two beers and I'm already a wreck

>Chorus

I'm not the best bassist to ever play with the Mud
Not even Nosferatu would suck on my blood
I'm just a warm Miller in a fridge of cold becks
Can't get no sleep. Can't get no sex.
