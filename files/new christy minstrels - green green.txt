[Written by Barry McGuire and Randy Sparks]  

C                    F
Green, green, it's green they say
        C               G
On the far side of the hill
  C                 F
Green, green, I'm going away 
              C         G       C
To where the grass is greener still

             C       Em
Oh, well, I told my Mama
        Am         G
On the day I was born
           F             G     C
Don't you cry when you see I'm gone
                C       Em
You know there ain't no woman
       Am        G
Gonna settle me down
        F        G         C
I just gotta be traveling on
A-singing...

Green, green, it's green they say
On the far side of the hill
Green, green, I'm going away 
To where the grass is greener still

Nah, there ain't nobody in this whole wide world
Gonna tell me how to spend my time
I'm just a good lovin' rambling man
Say, buddy, can you spare me a dime
Hear me crying, it's a...

Green, green, it's green they say
On the far side of the hill
Green, green, I'm going away 
To where the grass is greener still

Yeah, I don't care when the sun goes down
Where I lay my weary head
Green, green valley or rocky road
It's there I'm gonna make my bed
Easy, now...

Green, green, it's green they say
On the far side of the hill
Green, green, I'm going away 
To where the grass is greener still

Everybody, I wanna hear it now...

Green, green, it's green they say
On the far side of the hill
Green, green, I'm going away 
To where the grass is greener still

To where the grass is greener still
To where the grass is greener still
To where the grass is greener still
