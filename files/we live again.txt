We Live Again 

capo 3rd fret(thanks funkybot)

G A F# G E A C D

G               A         F#          G
these withered hands have dug for a dream
 E              A         C        D
sifted through sand and leftover nightmares
G         A      F#       G
over the hill a desolate wind
 E             A         C            D
turns shit to gold and blows my soul crazy 

    G 
the end
      A
o the end
F       C
we live again
Em                    Asus  A 
o i grow weary of the end 

o hungry days the footsteps of fools
gazing alone through sex-painted windows
dredging the night drunk libertines
stink like a colognes from the newfangled wasteland 

CHORUS

BRIDGE:
F                     C         E7   
love is a plague in a mix-match parade
          Am                   F
where the castaways look so deranged
E                                          Am
when will the children learn to let their wildernesses burn
     C           Em        Asus  A  A9  A         
and love will be new never cold and vacant

these withered hands have dug for a dream
sifted through sand and leftover nightmares 

CHORUS
