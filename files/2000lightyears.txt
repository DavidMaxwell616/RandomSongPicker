E         
Sun turning 'round with graceful motion
We're setting off with soft explosion
A
Bound for a start with fiery oceans
G
It's so very lonely
A                 B                E           
You're a hundred light years from home.

Freezing red deserts turn to dark
Energy here in every part
It's so very lonely
You're six hundred light years from home

It's so very lonely
You're a thousand light years from home

It's so very lonely
You're a thousand light years from home

Bell flight fourteen you now can land
See you on AldeBaran
Safe on the green desert sand
It's so very lonely
You're two thousand light years from home

It's so very lonely
You're two thousand light years from home
