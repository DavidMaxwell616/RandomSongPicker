She's Funny That Way-Gary Davis 
G Rag

Boys I got a gal she's just crazy about me
she's just as crazy as a gal could ever be
I found out she's not crazy she's just funny that way

12 months I had this gal before I could understand
I found out  she was just fool about some other man
The gal ain't crazy she's just funny that way

She'd come in sometimes with a face full a frown
Cause she thought she'd find another woman hangin round
bust she's not crazy she's just funny that way

She'd come in all time of the night she do what she please
she never satisfy but she got men running round her knees
this gal ain't crazy i found out she's just funny that way

I found a one man woman who treat her man right
and if she ever catch you with one boy you 'll have a scary fight
but she ain't crazy she just funny that way

She's nice and kind she kinda tight like that
but she always wants to know where the good men are at
she ain't crazy she just funny that way

She nice and kind and quiet as a mouse
Specially when she comes sneakin back into the house
this gal ain't crazy she just funny that way

Now men if you get tangled up with a gal like this
you better be sure to know what you doin'
cause there's plenty about this gal you'll find
enough to drive any young man to ruin
this gal ain't crazy she just funny that way

You know she quite jealous, jealous as a gal could be
she don't want her man going a step further than her eyes can see
but she ain't crazy she just funny that way

One thing about her she don't like no women friends
cause she don't want no one sneakin round trying to take her man in
gal is just funny that way

there's another space for a jealous hard workin women ain't willin to fill
ever catch you with your hands in the cookie jar she'll have you killed
good golly kid she just funny that way

shes a nice country gal she never been taught in no man school
she never met a man that she had long she's nobody's fool
but she ain't crazy she just funny that way

she'll work hard for you boy every day buy your clothes and shoes
you come in the evening and can't find them your gal will have the blues
gal ain't crazy she's just funny that way

She come in and kiss you while you're lying on the bed

Baby Let Me lay it on You
