  A      G#7            Cdim  E
  Stars shining bright above you
  A      G#7            F#7
  Night breezes seem to whisper I love you
  D                    Dm  
  Birds singing in the sycamore tree
  A               E#5    E   E7
  Dream a little dream of me

  Say "night-ie-night" and kiss me
  Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
  While I'm alone and blue as can be
  A               E       A 
  Dream a little dream of me

    F#    D#m        G#m9         C#7
    Stars fading, but I linger on dear,
    F#     Bmaj7  G#m     C#7
    Still craving yo - ur kiss
    F#   D#m        G#m9       C#7
    I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
    F#          F7  E7
    Just saying this

  Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
  Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
  But in your dreams what ever they be
  Dream a little dream of me
