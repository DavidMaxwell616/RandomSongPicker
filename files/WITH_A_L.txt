With a little luck, we can help it out.

We can make this whole damn thing work out.

With a little love, we can lay it down.

Can't you feel the town exploding?

The willow turns his back on inclement weather;
       A/B                                         E
And if he can do it, we can do it, just me and you,


             E/G#                  A
And a little luck, we can clear it up.
                   A/B           E
We can bring it in for a landing, 
              E/G#                    A      
With a little luck, we can turn it on.

There can be no misunderstanding.

With a little push, we could set it off.

We can send it rocketing skywards.

With a little love, we could shake it up.
