DEEP PURPLE 
--by Nino Tempo & April Stevens

          G           E           A7            D7          
When the deep purple falls over sleepy garden walls 
         G                             E  
and the stars begin to flicker in the sky 
          A7        D7    G           E           
Thru the mist of a memory You wander back to me 
 A7           D7          G    E A7  D7  
breathing my name with a sigh 

In the still of the night once again I hold you tight 
Tho your gone, your love lives on when moonlight beams 
And as long as my heart will beat sweet lover we'll always meet 
Here in my Deep Purple Dreams
