Thank You - Dido

Play | Em C |  8 times for the intro. C may be a Cmaj7, that is, E to e, X32000 or X32400.


Then | Em C | D  G D | is the verse.
     | Em C | D  G D |
     | Em C | D  G D |
     | Em C | Em/B C |

D/F# is 20023X. If you can't help strumming all the six strings, play 200230, as
in Pearl Jam's "Immortality".


Em            C                   D         G      D/F#   Em
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
            C                  D           G       D/F#   Em
The morning rain cloud's up my window, and I can't see at all
         C                D                     G       D/F#  Em
And even if I could, it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall
     C                  Em/B               C
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad    


Play | Em C | twice, and then verse again.


  Em         C                    D                G         D/F#     Em
I drank too much last night, got bills to pay, my head just feels in pain
              C                  D                G       D/F#   Em
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today, I'm late for work again
         C                     D                 G        D/F#     Em
And even if I'm there they'll all imply that I might not last the day
               C              Em/B               C
And then you call me and it's not so bad, it's not so bad


Then turn to | G | C | G | C | G | C | Bm | Am |
Repeat this 5 times (1st as chorus, 2nd instrumental, 3rd verse, 4th and 5th chorus)
Stress the B on A string when passing from G to C (that is, play a G/B x20033).
You can pick the right rythm for this if you look at the next verse (Push the door...).


    G           C
And I want to thank you
                   G              C
For giving me the best day of my life
    G           C
And oh, just to be with you
              Bm              Am
Is having the best day of my life


| G | C | G | C | G | C | Bm | Am |



G                  G/B      C                    G/B           G
Push the door, I'm home at last and I'm soaking through and through
                G/B   C              G/B     G
Then you handed me a towel and all I see is you
                      G/B   C                           Bm
And even if my house falls down now, I wouldn't have a clue
                Am 
Because you're near me... 


    G           C
And I want to thank you
                   G              C
For giving me the best day of my life
    G           C
And oh, just to be with you
              Bm              Am
Is having the best day of my life


    G           C
And I want to thank you
                   G              C
For giving me the best day of my life
    G           C
And oh, just to be with you
              Bm              Am
Is having the best day of my life



That's all.
