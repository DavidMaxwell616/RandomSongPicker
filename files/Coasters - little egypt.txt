Little Egypt by The Coasters

D
I went and bought myself a ticket and
                             D7        D
I sat down in the very first row, whoa whoa.
G
They pulled the curtain and then when
                                   G7         G
they turned the spotlight way down low, whoa, whoa.
       A
Little Egypt came out strutting, wearing nothing but a
             A7         A
button and a bow, whoa, whoa.
          G                     D
Singing,  Ying yang, Ying Yang..Ying yang, Ying yang...

D
She had a ruby on her tummy and a diamond big 
                D7         D
as Texas on her toe, whoa, whoa.
G
She let her hair down and she did the hoochie-koochie 
     G7          G
real slow, whoa, whoa.
A
When she did her special number on a Zebra skin,
                         A7          A
I thought she'd stop the show, whoa, whoa.
         G                     D
Singing, Ying yang, ying yang..ying yang, ying, yang..
 
CHORUS:
D                               D#
She did a triple somersault and when she hit the ground,
    E                          F
she winked at the audience and then she turned around.
          F#                  G
She had a picture of a cowboy tattooed on her spine,
         G#
it said, Phoenix, Arizona, nineteen forty-nine.

           D
Yeah, but, let me tell you people, Little Egypt doesn't
               D7          D
dance there anymore, whoa, whoa.
G
She's too busy mopping and taking care of shopping 
       G7           G
at the store, whoa, whoa.
A
Cause we got seven kids and all day long they
                 A7           A
crawl around the floor, whoa, whoa.
         G                     D
Singing, Ying yang..ying yang..ying yang..ying yang(x2)(fade)
