Stevie Wonder - Boogie on reggae woman

   G   
   I like to see you boogie
                     C
   Right across the floor
   A                   D
   I like to do it to you
                       G
   Till you holla for more
    
   I like to reggae
   But you dance too fast for me
   I'd like to make love to you
   So you can make me scream

                      A     C  
   Boogie on reggae woman
                       F                 
   What is wrong with me
                      A     D
   Boogie on reggae woman
                   G
   Baby can't you see
    
   I'd like to see both of us
   Fall deeply in love
   I'd like to see you naked
   Under the stars above
   Yes I would
    
   I'd like to see both of us
   Fall deeply in love - yeah
   I'd like to see you in the raw
   Under the stars above
    
   So boogie on reggae woman
   What is wrong with you
   Boogie on reggae woman
   What you tryin' to do
    
   Can I play? Can I play?
   No!
