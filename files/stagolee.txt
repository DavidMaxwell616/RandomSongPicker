Stagolee by Mississippi John Hurt

D                                       G6                   D                              
Police officer how can it be you can arrest everybody but cruel stagolee
A                      D
That bad man, oh cruel stagolee

He said "Stagolee, Stagolee, please don't take my life
I got two little babies and a darling loving wife."
He's a bad man, oh cruel stagolee

"what do I care about your two little babies and your darling loving wife 
you done stole my stetson hat and I'm bound to take your life
It's a magic hat," oh cruel stagolee

boom boom boom boom went a 44
when I spied Billy Lion he was lying down on the floor
That bad man, oh cruel stagolee

gentlemen of the jury what do you think of that
Stagolee killed Billy Lion for a 5 dollar stetson hat 
He's a bad man, oh cruel stagolee

standing on the gallows Stagolee did curse
judge said "let's kill him before he kills some of us"
He's a bad man, oh cruel stagolee

standing on the gallows his head was way up high
At 12:00 they was all glad to see him die
