Beercan


Alcohol on my hands
I got plans
to ditch myself and get outside 
dancing woman
throwing plates
decapitating their laughing dates
swirling chickens caught in flight
out of focus
much too bright
coming down
shiny teeth
game show suckers trying to bleed
but I got a drug and I got the bug
and I got something better than love

How you like me now 
pretty good
going on
feeling strong

I quit my job blowing leaves 
telephone bills up my sleeves
choking like a one man dustball
freedom rock slimeball
talking the cold wind down
lit up the shack
grab me a beer out of the sack
everybody bent over twice
painting the walls throwing some dice
leaping up into the air getting juiced up beyond belief

and they were singing like this

why go throwing Frisbees at the sun
put my soul between the bun
now I wandering now I'm drunk
now I'm running like a flaming pig

oh yeah 
scraping off the attitude
old man eating all my food
don't be kind
don't be rude
just shake your boots and let it all get loose

oh yeah 
my goodness 

fluffy clouds
jumping rainbows

fluffy clouds
I'm sad 
jumping rainbows
A soft and snuggly place

[repeat]

[chorus]

oh that's cold
somebody put a flame-thrower on me 

oh yeah
I like it like that

somebody bring me a plate of succotash
