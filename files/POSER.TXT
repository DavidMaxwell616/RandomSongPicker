HALF ASS

D7
unfinished projects line your shelves got pipedreams to spare
lost your edge, lost your friends and even losing your hair

G          
everytime there's people 'round 
    F                       D7
and everytime you're by yourself

A                 
ain't got no time to be a friend
G             A#              D7
you're still trying to be someone else


That paycheck that you flash in my face, I hope it doesn't last
the only position that you're fit to fill is flat on your ass 

rock star posture feigning grace a lounge lizard bore
no label buys your capricious fluff and your attitude du jour

narcissus was a chump to you with your circus mirror mind
a trailer made man with white trash clothes and a blue collar taste in wine

on your deathbed you'll find yourself and you'll have to swallow your pride
but even then it'll be too late and no one will come to your side
