D5             Dm             D5
Shiny, shiny, shiny boots of leather
D5                 Cm9     D5
Whiplash girlchild in the dark
D5                    Dm            D5
Comes in bells, your servant, don't forsake him 
D5                          Cm9      D5
Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart

Downy sins of streetlight fancies
Chase the costumes she shall wear
Ermine furs adorn the imperious
Severin, Severin awaits you there

F6    Bb    Bb#9  D5      
I am tired, I am weary
F6      Bb          Bb#9      D5      
I could sleep for a thousand years
F6         Bb     Bb#9        D5      
A thousand dreams that would awake me 
F6         Bb    Bb#9     D5      
Different colors made of tears

Kiss the boot of shiny, shiny leather
Shiny leather in the dark
Tongue of thongs, the belt that does await you 
Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart

Severin, Severin, speak so slightly
Severin, down on your bended knee
Taste the whip, in love not given lightly 
Taste the whip, now plead for me

Chorus

(repeat first verse)
