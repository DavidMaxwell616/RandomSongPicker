AIMLESS BUT SHAMELESS 

G
Well I'm a little slice of confusion, and my mind floats aimlessly. 
Unemployed, out of touch with Freud as I tailspin eternally. 
A#
As I plummet to the earth I got a dram on my hip.
G
It will take a sea of whiskey to save my sinking ship.

  F          D/F#                G
  Sinking or Rising, soon you'll see, 
  you won't find no lies inside of me
  You think you're rising, but soon you'll see 
  you can't keep blaming your lies on me
  Now  Satan's rising inside me and 
  soon you'll have some worms to feed

Some folks call me hopeless cause I got no sweltering pride
Pathos drowning Hubris, will be my alibi. Bands in town can
run around waiting to find or to be found while the wind
it whistles through their ears, makin' an eerie sound.

Chorus

Blind drunk in the dark I stagger, I don't need my eyes
to see My heart is true but my eyes deceive divert my soul
from whiskey. I don't need no cocaine, wheelchair or a crutch.
I'll just take your bottle, please, and thank you very much.
