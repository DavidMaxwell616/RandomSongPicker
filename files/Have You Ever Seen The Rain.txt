HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THE RAIN

By CREEDENCE CLEARWATER REVIVAL  ( CCR )


Intro....   G   C   G  

G
Someone told me long ago, there's a calm before the storm
   D                          G 
I know, it's been commin' for some time

When it's over so they say, it will rain a sunny day
   D                       G
I know shinnin' down like water


Chorus         C        D             G     Bm       Em     D
               I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain
               C        D             G     Bm       Em     D    C
               I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain
                        D              G
               Commin' down on a sunny day
  


Yesterday and days before
Sun is cold and rain is hot
I know, didn't I pay for all my time
And forever on it goes
Through the circle fast and slow
I know, it can't stop I wonder


Repeat chorus

Repeat chorus      Yeah  I wanna ......
