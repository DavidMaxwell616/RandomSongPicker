Young, gifted, and black 
Oh what a lovely, precious dream 
To be young, gifted, and black 
Open your heart to what I mean 

In the world you know 
There's a million boys and girls 
Who are young, gifted, and black 
And that's a fact 

Young, gifted, and black 
We must begin to tell our young 
There's a world waiting for you 
Yours is the quest that's just begun 

When you're feeling real low, 
There's a great truth you should know 
To be young, gifted, and black 
Your soul's intact 

Oh Young, gifted, and black 
Oh how I long to know the truth 
There were times when I look back 
When I am haunted by my youth 

Oh but my joys are of today 
Is that we can all be proud to say 
To be young, gifted, and black 
Is where it's at 

Young, gifted, and black 
We must begin to tell our young 
There's a world waiting for you 
Yours is the quest that's just begun 

When you're feeling real low, 
There's a great truth you should know 
To be young, gifted, and black 
Your soul's intact 

Oh Young, gifted, and black 
Oh how I long to know the truth 
There were times when I look back 
When I am haunted by my youth 

Oh but my joys are of today 
Is that we can all be proud to say 
To be young, gifted, and black 
Is where it's at, is where it's at, is where it's at...
