Path Train - Words by Erich Kuersten
chords - A D G C E, F G D F G C E, D C G D C G E,

I wait here for you to start, to take me to the city.
I see a girl who hurts my heart. She is much too pretty.
The rats, who scurry from your advancing lights, 
wish they could screech as loud as you, they can't.
But they can bite

Pull me, Path Train, into New York,
there's jobs and friends, 
restaurants and bars at which I'd like to be.
Close your doors. Ding your bell.  
Bring me to my favorite hell.
I can't breathe in here, 
her perfume chokes me like tear-gas, 
cutting through your city smell, 
leaving your sooty car a garden.

And there's nothing my roving eye can see, but her,
and maybe that ad for Irish Creme Liqueur.
But a picture cannot compare with the real thing. 
and though the Bailey's is obtainable,
it is across the Hudson.

And though the girl is close enough to touch, she is unapproachable,
bound to stay inaccessible as a dream, that fades away
within minutes of walking out of my station stop.
I wait for you, Path, to make the first move.

If I was more of a rat, I'd be screeching louder than you.
I'd be clawing at her shoulder, scaring her with my unconcealed adoration.
If I was more of a rat I'd be ripping the Irish creme ad off the wall
and eating it, I'd be out of this car and running ahead of you,
through the tunnel.

But I am just a passenger, less than human, a mask of disinterest,
a pretender who hides behind a vacant commuter's stare,
and stifles the song within, certain no one cares to hear.

Shut the doors and lets be off. Lets wake the rats once more,
I am thirsty for a drink and my friends are waiting at the bar. 
This girl I watch, I must forget her, mustn't even in my mind molest her.
I will keep my eyes on the liqueur ad and swear off reality forever.
I will keep my screeching inaudible.
