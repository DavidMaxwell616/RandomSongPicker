LACANSCIOUS SONG 1

G

Em                             Am
Well Lacan came a riding on a black Harley one day
D                                             G 
Gonna structure all the unconsciouses of the poor people that way
Em                             Am
Said you got a problem I got something about it to say
D                                       G
The unconscious is structured like a language

Bm                                     Em
The unconscious is structured like a language
D                       G
Saussure combines with Freud
Bm                                           Em
You gotta hope and dream but that don't mean it will never come true
         Am           D                           G
without das ding everything is structured like a language

Lacan and his french philosopher friends
tried to tell us what to think and what to do
but if you know about jungian archetypal symbolism
you might think that all his friends are quite foolish

But the unconscious is structured like a language
well that might be partially true
but if you were me and I were talking like a honeybee
would you say boo is structured like a language

Bm                       Em                           Am                          D   
Lacan and foucault were standing by a boat that was sinking mighty low under the sun
Bm                      Em                              Am                           G  
Lacan said Foucault why do you have to go and what the hell do you know about these guns

They're going boom be-de boom boom be-de boom, be-de boom be de-boom boom boom de boom
Gonna shoot down these parisian easterners

They're going boom be-de boom boom be-de boom, be-de boom be de-boom boom boom de boom

They're finding new masters

          Dm                              Am
But the unconscious is structured like a language
Cm                         G
Leave it or don't I don't care
Dm                          Am
Lacan's just a patriarchal puppet
               Cm                D
and when he's dead no one will care

Lacan Lacan, Lacan is structured like a language

Lacan, drop the bomb Lacan 
Drop the bomb on Ghengis Khan use structured language

I don't believe in partriarchal Lacaniasm
Foucault knew something that Lacan didn't know
how to write coherent sentences for students
