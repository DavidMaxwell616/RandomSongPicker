The Sun's Gonna Shine on My Back Door Some Day

E                B7
Trouble in mind, got the blues
A7
but they'll go away
           E            C#7    F#7      B7        E     
cause the sun's gonna shine on my back door some day

baby mind she's gone away
won't be gone to stay

take me out to the river
with a rocking chair

if the blues don't kill me 
I'll rock away my cares
