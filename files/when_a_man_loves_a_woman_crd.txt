When a Man Loves a Woman
Percy Sledge
key of C  (probably not the record's key)
 
intro      C  G/B  Am7  Am/G  F  G  C  G6
 
                  C           G/B   Am                        C7/G
verse1     When a man loves a woman,   can't keep his mind on nothing else
           F                  G                             C     G
             He'll trade the world for the good thing he's found
                    C            G/B    Am                 C7/G
           If she's bad he can't see it      she can do no wrong
           F                     G                         C    G
           Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down
 
verse2     When a man loves a woman, spend his very last dime
           Tryin' to hold on to what he needs
           He'd give up all his comfort, sleep out in the rain
           If she said that's the way it ought to be
 
          F           G            C
chorus     Well, this man loves a woman
           F            G            C
             I gave you everything I had
           F            G         C    E7/B     Am
             Tryin' to hold on to your precious love
           D7                          F/G   G+5
           Baby, please don't treat me bad
 
verse3     When a man loves a woman, down deep in his soul
           She can bring him such misery
           If she plays him for a fool, he's the last one to know
           Lovin' eyes don't ever see
 
chorus
 
                  C           G/B    Am                       C7/G
outro      When a man loves a woman,    I know exactly how he feels
               F          G              C     G   (repeat outro until tired)
           Coz baby baby baby you're my world
