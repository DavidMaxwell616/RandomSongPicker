Bottle of wine bottle of wine 
made me go and lose my mind
I spent my change I fell out of line
down in the bottom of a bottle of wine

I mowed the carpet I drank the shampoo
I smoked the wallpaper and sniffed all the glue
I turned on the strobelight went straight to bed
I drank a little wine for to straighten my head

I might just get the urge to roll out of bed
the dog isn moaning and my girlfriend is dead
dishes in the sink and bottom starts to itch
taking out the trash I fell in a ditch
