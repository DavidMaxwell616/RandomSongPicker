Gimme Some Money by      SPINAL TAP

Progression     1 = E E A D E
                2 = A A D C A
                3 = B B E D B

5 beats of A, then

Stop wasting my time         1
You know what I want    1
You know what I need    2
Or maybe you don't              1
Do I have to come right flat out and tell you everything        3  (start
playing at "right")

E                 A     D      E  A  D
Gimme some money
Gimme some money


Break --   Guitars slide into a B from Bb twice  and Keys answer with a BA
            Then all hit the  A  like at the beginning

I'm nobody's fool               1
I'm nobody's clown              1
I'm treatin you cool            2
I'm putting you down    1
But baby I don't intend to leave empty handed           3


Chorus

Break --

"Go Roger go.."

SOLO over verse

Chorus

Don't get me wrong    1    (Gimme some money)
Try getting me right    1       (Gimme some money)
Your face is o.k.     2
But your purse is too tight     1    (Gimme some money)
I'm looking for pound notes loose change bad checks, anything     3

Chorus  (Repeat and fade)
