The time has come for us to pause
and think of living as it was
Into the future we must pass

And I'd like to go with you-hoo
And I'd like to go with you-hoo

You say I'm harder than a wall
A marble shaft about to fall
I loved you dearer than them all aw-hall

And I'd like to go with you-hoo
And I'd like to go with you-hoo

(break)

And as we come out into day
The sky's blue has turned to grey
I might have not been here to say say-hay

Though I'm feelin' you inside
Still I'm rollin' with the tide
I'd like to see it be an open ri hide

Goin' along with you
Goin' along with you

(break)

And as we came out into view
There I found myself with you
And breathing felt like something new new-hoo

Goin' along with you
Goin' along with you
