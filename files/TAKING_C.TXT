{ 1 phrase guitar alone }

{ 3 phrase band }

They get up every morning from their long clock's warning
Take the eight fifteen into the city
There's a whistle up above and people push and people shoving
and the girl's who try to look pretty
and if your train's on time you can get to work by nine
and start to sleep and talk to get your pay
If you ever get annoyed look at me I'm self-employed
I love to work at nothing all day

and I've been (( taking care of business )) every day{<<falsetto}
(( Taking care of business )) every way
I've been (( taking care of business )), it's all mine
(( Taking care of business )), and working overtime, workout

{ guitar solo on 1 chorus }

There's work easy as fishing, you can be a musician
If you could make sounds loud or mellow
Get a second hand guitar and chances are you go far
If you get in with the right bunch of fellows
People see you having fun just a-lying in the sun
and tell them that you like it this way
It's the work that we avoid and we're all self-employed
We love to work at nothing all day

and we've been (( taking care of business )) every day
(( Taking care of business )) every way
We've been (( taking care of business )), it's all mine
(( Taking care of business )), and working overtime
..........Funkay!

{ guitar solo on 1 chorus }

{ 2 phrase }

Take good care of my business when I'm away every day, woo!
( Ha ha! Ya! )
