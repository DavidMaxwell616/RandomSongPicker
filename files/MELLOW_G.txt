@Song: Loser

In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey
butane in my veins so i'm out to cut the junkie
with the plastic eyeballs, spray paint the vegetables
dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
kill the headlights and put it in neutral
stock car flamin' with a loser and the cruise control
baby's in Reno with the vitamin D 
got a couple of couches sleep on the love seat 
someone keeps sayin' I'm insane to complain
about a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
don't believe everything that you breathe 
you get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
so shave your face with some mace in the dark
savin' all your food stamps and burnin' down the trailer park 

(yo cut it)

Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me?

(double-barrel buckshot)

Soy un perdedor
i'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?

Forces of evil in a bozo nightmare 
banned all the music with a phony gas chamber 
'cuz one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag
one's got on the pole shove the other in a bag
with the rerun shows and the cocaine nose job
the daytime crap with the folksinger slop
he hung himself with a guitar string
slap the turkey neck and it's hangin' on a pigeon wing
you can't write if you can't relate
trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate
and my time is a piece of wax fallin' on a termite
who's chokin' on the splinters

Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me? 

(get crazy with the cheeze whiz) 

Soy un perdidor
I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me? 

(drive-by body pierce) 

(yo bring it on down) 

soooooooyy.... 

(I'm a driver I'm a winner things are gonna change I can feel it) 

Soy un perdidor 
I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me? 

(I can't believe you) 

Soy un perdidor
I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me? 

Soy un perdidor
I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me? 

[repeat] 

(Sprechen sie Deutches, baby) 

Soy un perdidor 
I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me? 

(Know what I'm sayin'?) 

@Song:  Pay No Mind

(This's song two on the album
This is the album right here
Put on the album)

Tonight the city is full of morgues    
And all the toilets are overflowing
There's shopping malls coming out of the walls
As we walk out among the manure

That's why   
I pay no mind      
I pay no mind
I pay no mind

Give the finger to the rock and roll singer
As he's dancing upon your paycheck
The sales climb high through the garbage pail sky
Like a giant dildo crushing the sun

That's why
I pay no mind
I sleep in slime
I just got signed

So get out your lead-pipe pipe dreams
Get out your ten-foot flags
The insects are huge and the poison's all been used
And the drugs won't kill your day job

Honey, that's why
I pay no mind
I pay no mind
I pay no mind

That's why
I pay no mind [x7]

@Song: Fuckin With My Head (Mountain Dew Rock)

I ain't got no inclination
Give away my sweet sensation 
Sleepin' in an old toolshed 
Scumbag cryin' on his pillow 

Oooh...
When you wanna be with me then we will see
Who's fuckin' with my head
Hey hey hey hey
Fuckin' with my head
Hey hey hey hey

Found myself in New Orleans
With a scarecrow in my jeans
Feed my forehead through the ceilin'
Drank my coffee with a hubcap
Yeah

Oooh...
When you want to be with me then we will see
Who's fuckin' with my head
No no no no
Fuckin' with my head
Hey hey hey hey

Devil's got pantyhose on his head
Oh yeah, and he's robbin' me but all I got's cornbread
Well, you turn my body into a crutch
And now I'm limpin' all over when I feel your touch
Oh yeah

Oooh...
Oooh...

Float out on my checkout boot [?]
Runnin' wild on the bayou 
Now talkin' on a walkie-talkie
Credit card glued to my hand
Feels good

Oooh...
When you wanna be with me then we will see
Who's fuckin' with my head
Hey hey hey hey
No no no no
Fuckin' with my head
Make me feel like an asshole
I ain't got no soul
I ain't got no soul
No no no no
No no no no
No no no no
No no no no

@Song: Whiskeyclone, Hotel City 1997

(one more time)

I was born in this hotel
washing dishes in the sink
magazines and free soda 
trying hard not to think

lay it on to the dawn 
everything we done is wrong
I'll be lonesome when I'm gone
lay it on to the dawn

She can talk to squirrels
coming back from the convalescent home
staring at sports cars 
crying

rattlesnake on the ceiling 
gunpowder on my sleeve
I will live here forever
with the ocean and the bees

lay it on to the dawn 
everything we done is wrong
I'll be lonesome when I'm gone
lay it on to the dawn 

@Song: Soul Sucking Jerk

I got a job making money for the man
throwing chicken in the bucket with the soda pop can
puke green uniform on my back 
I had to set it on fire in a vat of chicken fat 
I leaped on the counter like a bird with no hair 
running through the mini mall in my underwear 
I got lost downtown couldn't find a ride home
sun went down I got frozen to the bone
'til a hooker let me share her fake fur coat
as I took a little nap the cops picked up us both
I tried to explain I was only trying to get warm 
I knew I never ever should have burnt my uniform
He said too bad.  You want to bite the bullet hard son?
I didn't have no teeth so I stole his gun
and I crawled out the window with my shadow on a spoon
dancing on the roof, shooting holes in the moon
get busy, get busy, you know it

I ain't going to work for no soul-sucking jerk
I'm gonna take it all back and I ain't saying jack
[repeat]

Standing right here with a beer in my hand
and my mouth is full of sand and I don't understand
fourteen days I've been sleeping in the barn
better I get a paycheck tattooed on my arm
whistling dixie with the dixie cup filled
with the barbecue sauce and the dental floss chill
big fat fingers pointing into my face
telling me to get busy cleaning up this place
I got bent like a wet cigarette 
and she's coming after me with a butterfly net
riding on the bloodhound ringing the bell
black cat wrapped in the road map to hell
pencil on my leg and I'm trying not to beg
taking turns baking worms with the bacon and eggs
well they got me in a bird cage flapping my jaw
like a pretzel in the stars just waiting to fall
so give me what I got to get so I can go
cause I ain't washing dishes in the ditch no mo(re)

I ain't going to work for no soul-sucking jerk
I'm gonna take it all back and I ain't saying jack

@Song: Truckdrivin Neighbors Downstairs (Yellow Sweat)

Acid casualty with a reposessed car
Vietnam vet playin' air guitar

It's just the shit-kickin', speed-takin', truck-drivin'
neighbours downstairs
Yeah
Yeah

Whiskey stained buck-toothed backwoods creep
Grizzly bear motherfucker never goes to sleep

It's just the shit-kickin', speed-takin', truck-drivin'
neighbours downstairs
Oh, yeah
Yeah

Belly floppin' naked in a pool of yellow sweat
Screamin' jackass with a wet cigarette

It's just the shit-kickin', speed-takin', truck-drivin'
neighbours downstairs
Oh
Oh, my goodness
Oh... [etc.]
Mmm... [etc.]

Psychotic breakdown double-edged axe
Growin' hair like a shag rug on a greasy back

It's just the shit-kickin', speed-takin', truck-drivin'
neighbours downstairs
Oh my goodness
Oh my goodness
[Sung under the following:] Oh... [etc.]
Oh, yeah
Come on, Honey, feel the grease
Grease, grease
Come on, Honey, feel the grease
Oh, my goodness
Come on, Honey, feel the grease
Oh yeah
Come on, lay it on me
Bring it down one more time
Come on, Honey...

@Song: Sweet Sunshine

Judge [?] me on the inside with a finger full of gravy
Wanna get you on the sofa, lady, wanna Shake and Bake me

Bucket full of blood
[???]
Gonna break my face on the sweet sunshine
Bucket full of blood
[???]
Gonna break my face on the sweet sunshine

I wanna get up off the floor
I wanna run to the devil and get me some more
I wanna get up off the floor
I wanna run to the devil and get me some more

[???] full of bread with your [???]
we are [???] and [???] and [???]

Grab your wine, tell me where you been
With the violin crime [?] and the moon gettin' thin
Grab your wine, take me where you been
With the violin [???] and the moon gettin' thin

I wanna climb up on the rug
I wanna swing through the city on a wreckin' ball
I wanna climb up on the rug
I wanna swing through the city on a wreckin' ball

Lay on to the dawn and [???] sensation
[???] timin' full of [???]

[???]
Gonna break my face on the sweet sunshine

I wanna get up off the floor
I wanna run to the devil and get me some more
I wanna get up off the floor
I wanna run to the devil and get me some more

@Song: Beercan

Alcohol on my hands
I got plans
to ditch myself and get outside 
dancing woman
throwing plates
decapitating their laughing dates
swirling chickens caught in flight
out of focus
much too bright
coming down
shiny teeth
game show suckers trying to bleed
but I got a drug and I got the bug
and I got something better than love

How you like me now 
pretty good
going on
feeling strong

I quit my job blowing leaves 
telephone bills up my sleeves
choking like a one man dustbowl
freedom rock slimeball
talking the cold wind down
lit up the shack
grab me a beer out of the sack
everybody been over twice
painting the walls throwing some dice
leaping up into the air getting juiced up beyond belief

and they were singing like this

why go throwing Frisbees at the sun
put my soul between the bun
now I wandering now I'm drunk
now I'm running like a flaming pig

oh yeah

scraping off the attitude
old man eating all my food
don't be kind
don't be rude
just shake your boots and let it all get loose

oh yeah 
my goodness 

fluffy clouds
jumping rainbows

fluffy clouds
I'm sad 
jumping rainbows
I saw him stuck in place

[repeat] 

[chorus] 

oh that's cold
somebody put a flame-thrower on me 

oh yeah 
I like it like that 

somebody bring me a plate of sassafrass

@Song: Steal My Body Home

Put me in a hole in the ground
With the money and the town
And the women learnin' to bow [?]

Can't complain about the mess
Momma killed her only dress
Now she's longin' for the pines

Watch my troubles all unwind
Drinkin' gasoline and wine
[???]

On the train they cannot feel
Lost my head beneath the wheel
Now she steals my body home

The trees are fake, the air is dead
The birds are stuffed with poison lead
And the ground is much too clean

And if it's only me who's scared
Strap 'em to the 'lectric chairs
Ring the moon like a broken bell

When she drags you from the hill
Daddy's gonna burn down the still
We can watch it from the rooftop

Ooh... [etc.]

Lay into the fryin' pan
Now she kisses her own hand
With the fiddle on the fire

I took a leap into the fog
Sleepin' on a hollow log
Now I'm coughin' with no mouth

You can keep yourself inside
But you know you cannot lie
When the devil's your only friend

Nnn, nnn... [etc.]

@Song: Nitemare Hippy Girl

She took me off my guard with disappointment
I got sucked inside of her apartment
She's got dried-up flowers, flakey skin
A beaded necklace and a bottle of gin

She's a nightmare hippy girl
With her skinny fingers fondlin' my world
She's a whimsical, tragical beauty
Self-conscious and a little bit fruity

It's a new age let-down in my face
She's so spaced out and there ain't no space
She's got marijuana on the bathroom tile
I'm caught in a vortex, she's changin' my style

[Backing vocals:] Ooh, ooh... [etc.]
She's a nightmare hippy girl
With her skinny fingers fondlin' my world
She's a whimsical, tragical beauty
Uptight and a little bit snooty

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Backing vocals:] Ooh, ooh... [etc.]
She's a magical, sparklin' tease
She's a rainbow chokin' the breeze
Yo, she's busting out onto the scene
With nightmare bogus poetry
She's a melted avocado on the shelf
She's the science of herself
She's spazing out on a cosmic level
And she's meditating with the devil
She's cooking salad for breakfast
She's got tofu the size of Texas
She's a witness to her own glory
She's a never-ending story
She's a frolicking depression
She's a self-inflicted obsession
She's got a thousand lonely husbands
She's playin' footsie in another dimension
She's a goddess milking the time for all that it's worth

@Song: Mutherfuker

yo homey don't play that game
hey mr. asshole
what you dirty asshole
sitting in your castle
judging everyone 
you're acting like it's chill
when the deal's getting ill
why don't you break your face or mine

everyone's out to get you motherfucker
[repeat] 

total paranoia
trying to annoy you
everything I do
is to try to fuck you up
screw chum chewin
the house of spasm 
drunk so long
in this situation

everyone's out to get you motherfucker
[repeat] 

@Song: Blackhole

Windy
Windy
looking for a better home
gotta be
gotta be 
running out of lightbulbs
crowded
crowded 
open to a wastecan
yellow car
yellow car 
better be inside there
wake up
wake up
nothing's gonna harm you
glass wall
glass wall 
standing on the furniture
little boy
little boy 
laying on a sleeping bag
watching
watching 
through the cracks of his eyelids 
stranger 
stranger 
feeling like a broken stone
lost him
lost him
standing on the orange chairs
alphabet
alphabet
can't afford a telephone
black hole
black hole
nothing's gonna harm you
