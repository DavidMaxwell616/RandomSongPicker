D   C                 A          F  G  
I'm just enjoying the atmosphere        
while my head fights against becoming clear. 
Grownups trained with childhood fear. 
Worries drained through great big steins of beer. 
Questions as vague as daughters of Lear. 
Signs of hope very far from near.

D               F           C     C#dim
To them life is deprecating and devoid,
the torture it turns as a man turns into boy
We all are drowning in our seas of obey 
we lose more opportunity every single day

F G D

Glasses are emptied and our dreams realized
Some draw their swords way too quick and then  surmise
That the unfelt passions behind our eyes
Make the lewd unlucky ones deify
All our visions are poor and bleak 
just to scan one horizon takes too many weeks. 

D                F            C           C#dim          
Our strength is gone and the weakness it reigns 
as obligatory minds drive us into the sane. 
We all are drowning in our seas of obey 
we lose more opportunity every single day

       F          G              D 
The unconscious flees from mundanity. 
 F         G         D  
True realization is Ellis Dee
True realization is Ellis Dee
True realization is Ellis Dee

Blood is everywhere, (it's in de streets)
kind blood is everywhere (it's in your eyes)
etc.
