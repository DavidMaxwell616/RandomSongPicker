I knew you lost your way
when you had nothing more to say
D7              D7/C              D7/B                  A#        
I knew you had enough of me my petty needs and selfish frays

you'll never have to worry about me again

now I know why you ran
you will never give all that you can
I poured it out you sucked me dry reality is a cheap aliby
you'll never have to worry about me again

I thought I knew you well 
but you turned your heels and bid farewell
I tried the best to make it gel but even you can't save you from yourself
you'll never have to worry about me again

what could you possibly ever want from me
I'm incomplete and slovenly
it's too late to save you from yourself

you can try to forget it now
but the memories will hold you down too
