PAINTED EYELIDS

guitar tuned down 1/2 step

A                             E
I wake up and look upon your painted eyelids
     F#                          E7
The world is your oyster and the trash bags are your kids
     A                              E
The ceiling is invisible there's a bird sinkin thru the sky
F#                             E7 
And every hour that passes is teachin me how to cry
          D7                 A
Cuz it's lonely here in the ugly part of town
     B7                               E7
The buildings are all vacant and the telephones are down

There's a police siren singing like a tiger with no skin
The sewer drain is glowing and I don't know what state I'm in
And the river is on fire there's chemicals and debris
And all the roads are blocked off they're just too hard to see
So cancel my appointments and set up a whole new show
Cuz I'm in need of a good hot meal and a life to call my own

(Harmonica solo over A-E-F#-E7)

So get me a plate of money get me a blanket and a chair
The limitations are limitless they're floating thru the air
Cuz it's real and it's true the things I see in you
And there's nothin I wouldn't talk about with the clearest dream
                  A
that ever drifted by
