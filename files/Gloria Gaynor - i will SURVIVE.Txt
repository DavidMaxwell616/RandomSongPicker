verses and chorus:(i'm not so sure 'bout the lyrics)

Am
at first i was afraid
Dm
i was petrified
G
i kept thinking i could never live
C
without you by my side
F
then i spent so many nights
B
just thinking how you did me wrong
E
i grew strong
E
i learned how to get along

you get the idea...

At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
Then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along

And so you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here, with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

Go on now, go walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Coz you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh no not I, I will survive
For as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And I've got all my love to give
I'll survive
I will survive
Hey hey

(I, I will survive)
Hey hey
(I, I will survive)
Every day
(I, I will survive)
Oh yeah

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Just trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high
And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free
But now I'm savin' all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

Go on now, go walk out the door
Just turn around now
You're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh no not I, I will survive
Oh as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And I've got all my love to give
I'll survive
I will survive
Hey hey

Go now, go walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Coz you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh no not I, I will survive
Oh as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And I've got all my love to give
I'll survive
I will survive
I will survive

(I, I will survive)
Hey
(I, I will survive)
Every day
(I, I will survive)
Yeah yeah

(I, I will survive)
Oh
(I, I will survive)
I will survive
(I, I will survive)

(I, I will survive)
I've got all my love to give
(I, I will survive)
I've got all my life to live
(I, I will survive)
My loving is not in vain, oh no

(I, I will survive)
I will survive
(I, I will survive)
I will survive
(I, I will survive)
Hey

(repeat to end)
