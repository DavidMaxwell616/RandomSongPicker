When I look back on all the crap I learned in High School
Em            A               D     Em      A7
It's a wonder I can think at all 
                D     Dmaj7  D7          G   
And though my  lack of education hasn't  hurt me none
Em               A              D 
I can read the writing on the wall
     G G/F# Em                     Am          D
Kodachrome     They give us those nice bright colours 
                   G        C         
They give us the greens of summers,  
                A         D             G   G/F# Em 
Makes you think all the world's a sunny day Oh yeah!
         Am    D
I got a Nikon camera,  I love to take a

             D      Dmaj7     D7                G        
If you took all the girls I knew  when I was single
Em                      A               D     Em      A7
And brought them all together for one night       
               D      Dmaj7     D7           G        
I know they'd never   match my  sweet  imagination
Em                    A                  D     
And everything looks worse in black and white  
     G G/F# Em                     Am          D
