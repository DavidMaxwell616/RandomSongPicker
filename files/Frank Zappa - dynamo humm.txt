One two three four

I couldnt say where shes comin from,
But I just met a lady named dinah-moe humm

She stroll on over, say look here, bum,
I got a forty dollar bill says you cant make me cum
No way!
(y'jes can't do it)

She made a bet with her sister whos a little bit dumb
She could prove it any time all men was scum

I dont mind that she called me a bum,
But I knew right away she was really gonna cum
(so I got down to it)

I whipped off her bloomersn stiffened my thumb
An applied rotation on her sugar plum

I pokedn stroked till my wrist got numb
But I still didnt hear no dinah-moe humm,
Dinah-moe humm

Dinah-moe humm
Dinah-moe humm
Wheres this dinah-moe
Comin from
I just spent three hours
An I aint got a crumb
From the dinah-moe, dinah-moe, dinah-moe
From the dinah-moe humm

I got a spot that gets me hot
But you aint been to it
I got a spot that gets me hot
But you aint been to it

I got a spot that gets me hot
But you aint been to it
I got a spot that gets me hot
But you aint been to it
And I cant get into it
Unless I get out of it
An I gotta be out of it
To get myself into it
cause I cant get into it
Unless I get out of it
An I gotta be out of it
Before I get into it

(she looked over at me with a glazed eye
And some bovine perspiration on her upper lip area
And she said...)
And heres what she said:
Just get me wasted
An youre half-way there
cause if my minds tore up,
Well, then my body dont care

I rubbed my chinny-chin-chin
An said my-my-my
What sort of thing
Might this lady get high upon? 

The forty dollar bill didnt matter no more
When her sister got nekkid an laid on the floor
She said dinah-moe might win the bet
But she could use a little (ow!) if I wasnt done yet

I told her...
Just because the sun
Want a place in the sky
No reason to assume
I wouldnt give her a try

So I pulled on her hair
Got her legs in the air
An asked her if she had any cooties in there

(whaddya mean cooties! no cooties on me!)

She was buns-up kneelin
Buns up!
I was wheelin an dealin
Wheelin an dealin an ooooh!
She surrender to the feelin
She sweetly surrendered
An she started in to squealin

Dinah-moe watched from the edge of the bed
With her lips just twitchin an her face gone red
Some drool rollin down
From the edge of her chin
While she spied the condition
Her sister was in
She quivered n quaked
An clutched at herself
Her sister made a joke
About her mental health
Until dinah-moe finally
Did give in
But I told her
All she really needed
Was some discipline...

I said:

Kiss my aura...dora...
Thats right!
You know why? 
Because obviously it was real angora
And then I said:

Would you all like some more-a? 
Right here on the flora? 
An how bout you, fauna? 
Do you wanna? 

...frank, frank...up on stage...up on stage, frank...
