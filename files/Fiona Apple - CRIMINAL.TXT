"Criminal" Track #4 5:41 

Cm

Am                   F
I’ve been a bad bad girl 
Am                          F 
I’ve been careless with a delicate man 
Am                  F
And it’s a sad sad world 
Am                      
When a girl will break a boy 
F
Just because she can 
C          Bb         F          
Don’t you tell me to deny it 
            C          
I’ve done wrong and I want to 
Bb          A
Suffer for my sins 
C             Bb        
I’ve come to you ‘cause I need 
Ab              G   
Guidance to be true 
            F                      Ab  
And I just don’t know where I can begin 

F                  Cm
What I need is a good defense 
             F                 Cm
‘Cause I’m feelin’ like a criminal 
       F           
And I need to be redeemed 
        Cm                Bb
To the one I’ve sinned against 
              Ab    G            F
Because he’s all I ever knew of love 

Heaven help me for the way I am 
Save me from these evil deeds 
Before I get them done 
I know tomorrow brings the consequence 
At hand 
But I keep livin’ this day like 
The next will never come 

Oh help me but don’t tell me 
To deny it 
I’ve got to cleanse myself 
 Of all these lies till I’m good 
Enough for him 
I’ve got a lot to lose and I’m 
Bettin’ high 
So I’m gettin’ you before it ends 
Just tell me where to begin 

What I need is a good defense 
‘Cause I’m feelin’ like a criminal 
And I need to be redeemed 
To the one I’ve sinned against 
Because he’s all I ever knew of love 

Eb      B       Ab     B
Let me know the way 
Eb      B       Ab     B
Before there’s hell to pay 
Give me room to lay the law and let me go 
I’ve got to make a play 
To make my lover stay 
So what would an angel say 
The devil wants to know 

What I need is a good defense 
‘Cause I’m feelin’ like a criminal 
And I need to be redeemed 
To the one I’ve sinned against 
Because he’s all I ever knew of love 

What I need is a good defense 
‘Cause I’m feelin’ like a criminal 
And I need to be redeemed 
To the one I’ve sinned against 

Because he’s all I ever knew of love
