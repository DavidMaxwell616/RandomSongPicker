SHOTFACED

Em      
As I sit here, I wonder why, I'm still on the ground and I cannot fly 
Am
Watch me fumble, like so many times before.
G                C                  Em     
Watch me stumble and wind up on the floor. 
D                      A                Em
I'm just too shotfaced everyday it gets worse. 
B7                                              Em
Tried to find my love, but the whiskey found me first.

People around here feign sympathy the same.
Feets don't fail me now, I got to get away.
Everybody is so incomplete. 
Change your position, you will lose your seat. 
Just too shotfaced, if you don't mind, I'm satisfied. 
I might have tortured you, but at least I never lied

  Em                              
  All numbers add up to the same, 
  Am 
  Emotions never play that game
  Em                                         B7 
  I don't know what should matter most but I say
  Em
  sobers don't play straight games anyway

Pathetic, esoteric and lonely it's true 
But still I slide uphill and look sadly down at you. 
Please don't ask me why.
If I knew when I answered, 
I'd have looked you dead in the eye. 
We're all alone, all alone in our minds.
We're all alone, all alone in our minds.
I tried to find my love, but the whiskey met the kind.
