KING HEROD'S SONG (TRY IT AND SEE) 

(Herod) 
Em           Em/D     
Jesus, I am overjoyed
     C               G
To meet you face to face
Em                          Em/D     
You've been getting quite a name
 C               G
All around the place
 Em       Bm
Healing cripples
 C                 G
Raising from the dead
C      G/B   Am          G           
Now I understand you're God
C               G/B          Am    D
At least that's what you've said 

    G    
So you are the Christ
            A7        
You're the great Jesus Christ
 D             
Prove to me that you're divine
G
Change my water into wine
That's all you need do
           A7
Then I'll know it's all true
 D                 G
C'mon King of the Jews 

Jesus you just won't believe The hit you've made around here
You are all we talk about You're the wonder of the year
Oh what a pity If it's all a lie
Still I'm sure That you can rock the cynics if you try

So if you are the Christ Yes the great Jesus Christ
Prove to me that you're no fool Walk across my swimming pool
If you do that for me Then I'll let you go free
C'mon King of the Jews 

I only ask what I'd ask any superstar What is it that you have got
That puts you where you are? (Oh, ho ho)
I am waiting Yes I'm a captive fan
I'm dying to be shown That you are not just any man 

So if you are the Christ Yes the great Jesus Christ
Feed my household with this bread You can do it on your head
Or has something gone wrong? Jesus, why do you take so long?
Aw, c'mon King of the Jews 

Hey! Aren't you scared of me Christ? Mr. Wonderful Christ!
You're a joke, you're not the Lord You are nothing but a fraud
Take him away He's got nothing to say!
Get out you King of the
Get out you King of the,
Get out you King of the Jews!
Get out of here, you, you!
Get out of here, you!
Get out of my Life!
