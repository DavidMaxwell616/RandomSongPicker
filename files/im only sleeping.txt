Back to Chords

(i think this should be played with a capo on 4... otherwise start with
Bm and it will do fine- top line are the chord forms, bottom line is in
the right key [at least the recording I have])

Em                           Am      G      C       G        B7
When I wake up early in the morning/lift my head   I'm still yawning
Em                           Am    G      C      G      C       Am
When I'm in the middle of a dream/Stay in bed   Float upstream
  G                  Am                 Bm              Am
Please don't wake me/no don't shake me/leave me where I am
           Cmaj7      
I'm only sleeping...

(bridge part, after verses 2 and 3 I believe...)
Dm7                    E7                Am
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window, taking my time

2. Everybody seems to think I'm lazy/I don't mind/I think they're crazy
   Running everywhere at such a speed/'til they find/There's no need
   Please don't spoil my day/I'm miles away/and after all
   I'm only sleeping...
   
3. Lying there and staring at the ceiling/Waiting for/a sleepy feeling
   Please don't spoil my day/I'm miles away/And after all
   I'm only sleeping...
