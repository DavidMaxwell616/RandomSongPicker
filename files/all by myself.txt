ALL BY MYSELF 

(ERIC CARMEN, SERGEI RACHMANINOFF)

G          
When I was young
        Cm        G 
I never needed anyone
           G7        G6       Am          
And making love was just for fun
Cm               G    Cm D7
Those days are gone
Livin' alone
I think of all the friends I've known
When I dial the telephone
Nobody's home

G7 E7 A Am Cm D7

G         Bm
All by myself
Don't wanna be
G7      G6  Am   
All by myself
Cm   D
Anymore

Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And love so distant and obscure
Remains the cure

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna live
All by myself
Anymore

When I was young
I never needed anyone
Making love was just for fun
Those days are gone

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna live
Oh
Don't wanna live
By myself
Anymore
Oh
