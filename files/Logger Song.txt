Logger Song

   C                   G7                     C 
As I strolled out one evening into a small cafe
               D7         G7                  C          
A 40 year old waitress to me these words did say
                  G7                      C    
"I see you are a logger and not a common bum
                     D7           G7               C
'Cause no one but a logger stirs coffee with his thumb
                G7                          C  
My lover was a logger, but not like none today
                   D7              G7             C 
If you put whiskey on it, it will ease the pain away
