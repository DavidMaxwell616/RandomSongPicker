D                  C   
Along about 1825 I left Tennessee very much alive
  D 
I never would've got through the Arkansas mud
                               C         D
if I hadn't been ridin' on the Tennessee Stud
  D                         
I had some trouble with my sweetheart's pa
        C 
and her brother was a bad outlaw 
D                             
left her a letter with her Uncle Fudd 
    D                  Am        D
and I rode away on the Tennessee Stud

     D
The Tennessee Stud was long and mean,
 G                       Asus      A
color of the sun and his eyes were green
D 
He had the nerve and he had the blood
                                      Am        D   
and there never was a horse like the Tennessee Stud

D                                        
We headed right down through No Man's Land
        C
and we crossed that river called the Rio Grande
  D
I raced my horse with a Spaniard's fold
                            C          D  
and I won me a skin full of silver and gold
D
Me and a gambler we couldn't agree
   C
we got in a fight over Tennessee
   D
I drew my gun and he fell with a thud
                       Am         D
and I rode away on The Tennessee Stud

(chorus)

D
I was as lonesome as a man could be,
C
dreamin' of my girl in Tennessee
D
The Tennessee Stud's green eyes turned blue
                               C          D      
'cause he was dreaming of his sweetheart too
    D
We loped right back across Arkansas
  C 
I whupped her brother and I whupped her paw
  D
I found that girl with golden hair 
                                 Am         D
and the Tennessee Stud found the Tennessee Mare

(Chorus)

D
Saddle by saddle and side by side 
   C  
we crossed the mountains and the valleys wide 
   D
we got to big muddy and we forded the flood
                               Am        D  
on the Tennessee Mare and the Tennessee Stud 
D
Pretty little baby on the cabin floor
      C  
and a little horse colt buckin' 'round the door
  D
I love that girl with the golden hair
                                 Am         D    
and the Tennessee Stud loves the Tennessee Mare

(Chorus)
