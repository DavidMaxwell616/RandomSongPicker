THIS WHEEL'S ON FIRE- Bob Dylan and The Band
        Am
If your mem'ry serves you well,
                 Bdim
We were goin' to meet again and wait,
       E
So I'm goin' to unpack all my things
    Dm           (F)       Am
And sit before it gets too late.
   C              Am
No man alive will come to you
       C               Am
With another tale to tell,
        C                  Am
And you know that we shall meet again
        Dm     F          Am
If your mem'ry serves you well.

Dm         F    
wheel's on fire,
C                G
Rolling down the road,
     C   G     F       C
Best notify my next of kin,
F          G       A
This wheel shall explode!

If your mem'ry serves you well,
I was goin' to confiscate your lace,
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot
And hide it in your case.
If I knew for sure that it was yours . . .
But it was oh so hard to tell.
But you knew that we would meet again,
If your mem'ry serves you well.

CHORUS

If your mem'ry serves you well,
You'll remember you're the one
That called on me to call on them
To get you your favors done.
And after ev'ry plan had failed
And there was nothing more to tell,
You knew that we would meet again,
If your mem'ry served you well.
CHORUS
