WAITING FOR THE BOURBON

G-G6-Gmaj7

As I look out over the cornfields
I can see what's goin on in my whiskey still
All of that bourbon goin through my tanks
And big round vats it will cool down there for years

Dm/F               F                         G
and all I wanna do is drink some bourbon with you
Everytime I look your way all I can ever think of to say
is come on home my stash of homegrown is waiting 
crawl along crawl up to my bowl and wait for me
cause when I look around this is what I see I am not lonely
for bourbon and aspirin and you

Dm                  F                       G
all I want to do is drink some bourbon with you
all everybody wants from me is a shot of whiskey
and a hit of THC they always turn me loose at night
I catch the path train home and cry until I vomit
in my clay and I'm lonesome

Eddie Vedder:
Everybody wants to have a little
Everybody wants to fall asleep before one
Dm                           F             G
Especially when they have to work the next day

I don't care 'cause all I do is play
with everything I come in contact with
I throw it through a copper tube and mix it with bourbon
all the things I held dear crumble into the sand

G/D G/C
            Dm
and they're waiting for an answer
        F
They're waiting for the sun
          C        G            Asus        
They're waiting for bourbon for bourbon
    A                    G
for bo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-or-bon
C           G    
Mix it with sweet vermouth
            A
Mix it with ice
C        
Mix it with ginger ale
G                 Asus     A
Diet coke or diet slice

repeat and fade...
