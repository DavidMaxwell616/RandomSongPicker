SLEEPWALKING GIRL

         E                D           C
there's someone standing outside my window
         E                D       Am
there's someone looking inside at me
     E      D          C    
but nobody else ever notices them
       G      D         E  
is it real or is it a dream

      E                  D           C
then I'm driving down a rainy old highway
     E              D           Am
the wipers keeping beat to the tune
     E      D          C    
though the sky is black I cannot remember
       G      B7         E  
is it midnight or is it noon

F#m                D        E             
at the end of the day I'm excited
F#m                  D           E             
in the morning I am dead to the world
F#m                   D             E             
will I ever find the punchline to my riddle
       G            D           E
will I ever find a sleepwalking girl

alone on a beach in the winter
surrounded on a subway in the fall
the destination is growing so murky
and the details I cannot recall

floating on a raft in a river
trippin round a park in the rain
did it happen or is it still happening
I don’t seem to remember a thing

Too lost in my thoughts to feel anger
It’s a lonely place a fantasy hell
Awake or asleep it is not frightening
Because it’s already too late to tell

Dancing with a shadow at midnight
Fighting with the night for some peace
forgive the morning for bringing me questions
and the the daymares will finally cease
