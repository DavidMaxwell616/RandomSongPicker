Lost & Found

G         Am	
I’m in a lonely place 
D7                  G
got nowhere else to go 
cannot forget your face 
the ring upon your toe 
woke up in an empty bed 
cold morning quiet room 
ate my breakfast in my car 
sleepwalked till afternoon

F	C
I don’t care anymore 

                G
if I’m late or early
F	     C
to my friends I might seem 
           G
tense and surly
	D7	G 
But it soon will end 
            F             C
and I will find another friend
    D7        G	
And she will soothe 
        F          C
all of my frayed nerves
    A7	             D   D7
and give me things that only I deserve

My friends don’t ring no more 
just the pesky realtor
Soon my country home will sell 
and I will be out of this hell
I’ll find a castle in new york and  eat slow movers with a fork
and when I get there there will be 
no shadow hanging over me

watching movies all night long 
and doing things you think are wrong 
Turkey keeps me company 
and the guitar on my knee
a temporary oversight 
I still remember every fight
it was worth all of my dues 
I’ll never forget every single truce
