A piercing car alarm awakens me at the crack of dawn
A dawn that lasts throughout the day my beauty sleep is gone
Urine stench and diesel fumes permeate the air
Dumpster diving homeless panhandle everywhere

It's a long time since I've called it my home
Weekends of ragin are now gone
forever do I feel so alone 
In my home

Screaming taxis pollute the streets young latinos pollute the walls
Addled kids pollute their heads with drugs and alcohol
A lonely hanging in Germantown 300 births in Queens
A Tribecan sculptor wines and dines a Brooklyn teacher screams

Stuck up beauties lord the street in their fashion district minds
Pretentious yuppies and Euro trash wait for cheesy clubs in lines
Blustery snow turns to slush in the winter streets
No streams, no beach no swimming pools to stave the summer heat

Suburban bliss is now mine to have the rural tilt a whirl
While the concrete scream machine up north has become a distant world
But I'm not altogether without the strife and turmoil
'cause I brought along with me for luck A New York City Girl
