Ab A            Ab A      G       F#     F
    Arnold Layne    had a strange hobby.

E                      A         G       D     E
   Collecting clothes, moonshine washing line.

        D    C   A
   They suit him fine.

Ab A           Ab A       G       F#      F
    On the wall    hung a tall    mirror.

E                    A           G    D   E
   Distorted view,   see-through baby blue.

      D   C
   He dug it.

   G   D      A      C    G       D     C     G      D
   Oh, Arnold Layne, it\'s not the same, takes two to know.

   E            G            A
   Two to know, two to know, two to know.
 
                    D D G G E E A
   Why can\'t you see?

Ab A              Ab A            Ab A
     Arnold Layne,   Arnold Layne,     Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne!

Ab A                Ab A        G       F#      F
    Now he\'s caught,    a nasty sort of person.

E                       A             G     D    E
   They gave him time,  doors bang,   chain gang.

      D     C
   He hates it!       
 
   G   D      A      C    G       D     C     G      D
   Oh, Arnold Layne, it\'s not the same, takes two to know.

   E            G            A
   Two to know, two to know, two to know.
 
                    D D G G E E A
   Why can\'t you see?

Ab A              Ab A            Ab A
     Arnold Layne     Arnold Layne    Arnold Layne


   A      G           E       A 
   Arnold Layne don\'t do it again!
