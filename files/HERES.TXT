HERE'S LOOKING AT YOU
BLONDIE

As I sit staring into this liquid amber

ripples move out to the edge of the glass

I just want to jump into the warm depths

F                              A
My initials sprayed across the pavement

Cut into your private interview

If I ever had a million dollars
Dm                             Bb

Thought I'd like to have a little party
Thought I'd like to have a little do
Sure I stopped drinking but for the moment
Honey, here's looking at you

I'll stop my drinking, give you my promise true
Clean out the closet, be existential
And cast a vote for the president too
But for the action of the moment
Nothing does what it ought to do
Instant depression, I learned my lesson
Nothing that I'd rather do
Come on over my place
Can't see him sideways
Honey, here's looking at you
Oh
