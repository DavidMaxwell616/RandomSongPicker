There's a tramp sittin' on my doorstep tryin to waste his time     
with his mentholated sandwich he's a walking clothes line     
And here comes the bishops daughter on the other side     
She looks a trifle jealous she's been an outcast all her life               
Me, I'm waiting so patiently lying on the floor      
I'm just trying to do my jig-saw puzzle before it rains anymore              

Oh the gangster looks so frightning with his luger in his hand     
when he gets home to his children he's a family man     
but when it comes to the nitty-gritty he can shove in his knife     
Yes he really looks quite religious he's been an outlaw all his life               
Me, I'm waiting so patiently lying on the floor      
I'm just trying to do this jig-saw puzzle before it rains anymore               
Me, I'm waiting so patiently lying on the floor      
I'm just trying to do this jig-saw puzzle before it rains anymore              

Oh the singer, he looks angry at being thrown to the lions     
And the bass player, he looks nervous about the girls outside     
And the drummer, he was shattered trying to keep up time     
And the guitar players look damaged they've been outcasts all thier lives               
Me, I'm waiting so patiently lying on the floor      
I'm just trying to do this jig-saw puzzle before it rains anymore              

And as twenty thousand grandma's waving thier hankies in the air     
All burning up their pensions and shouting, "It's not fair!"     
There's a regiment of soldiers standing looking on     
And the queen is bravely shouting, "What the Hell is going on?"
With a blood-curdling "tally-ho" she charged into the ranks     
And blessed all those grandma's who with their dying breaths screamed, "Thanks!" 
Me, I'm waiting so patiently with my woman on the floor      
We're just trying to do this jig-saw puzzle before it rains anymore
