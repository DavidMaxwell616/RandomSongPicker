G         Dm7                C      A7                
Whiskey might not cure your women blues, 
            G      Ebmaj7    G
but it can make em sweet as honey
G          Dm7       C       A7                
Women can cure you whiskey blues, 
G             Ebmaj7          G
but then they take ½ of your money
D       F           G       A#
Money blues can be cured by either, 
            G         F 
but if you don't got money, 
C             Eb7
you wont get neither,
     G                   A#           
and you'll just have the sober single 
C           G
poor man's blues...

If you're leaving Vegas 
Skyy vodka in one hand
Italian ice in the other
Then you may wind up sober as I am
A shakeless screamless emaciated brother
but that wont cure nothin but good times, and the women will stay far from ya too,
and you'll be left with the sober single poor man's blues....

When a woman's givin you love, oh man, there's no mountain you can't climb
you walk 2 feet off the sidewalk all day, and feel like a kid at Christmas time
but then one long painful rainy day
she leaves you feeling 
lower than your shoes,
drownin' in a pool of sober single poor man's blues.

So if the doctor says 
you'll never drink no more, 
and girls say 
you’ll get no play from us
and your family's too far away 
for comfort or money, 
without getting on some greyhound bus,
then pour yourself 
a cup of alcanon coffee, 
and put some Simpsons on the tube,
     G              F                C        Eb7 
and suffer like a Christian facing lions, 
         G               
through another night of 
A#            C          G 
sober single poor man's blues.
