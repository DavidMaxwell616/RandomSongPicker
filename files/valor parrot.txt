Fm                                  Bb                C
She's chilled on ice got a frosty bite that I can't resist
accommodation and presentation can rarely coexist
treetop fruit bears nectar so succulent and sweet
but to stay aloft on limbs so slim is an acrobatic feat

chorus:
C#           G#                               Fm
Truth is so irrelevant in a fun house mirror mind
C#                     G#
sincerity is not very elegant
                         A#            C7#5         
to a trampled scapegoat flying blind

Privilege and Pampering can taint even the purest heart
the eyes betray a child within hiding from the war
forcefed trauma nose-fed anesthesia
pills and vodka shots and selective amnesia

(chorus)

I like my humor salted I like my whiskey neat
I like my brand new fancy pants and I like the way they look on me
I like to screen my phone calls and I like to talk in my sleep
I like my indiscretions and I like them indiscreet

2nd chorus:
tell her what she wants to hear 
not what she needs to know
reality is so irrelevant
in the dream-pipe players' puppet show
