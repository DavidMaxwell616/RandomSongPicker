Who can turn the world on with her smile
G        Bm      Em              Am                   D
who can take a nothing day and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile
           Em                      C
well it's you girl and you should know it
      Am7                           D7
with each glance and every little movement

Love is all around no need to waste it
G                           C
you can have the town why don't you take it
G       Em     Am     D     G

but it's time you started living
Am7                    D7
time you let someone else do the giving
G                      C
Love is all around no need to waste it
G                           C
you can have the town why don't you take it
G    Em        Am       D     G
you might just make it after all
