<H2> Abilene, Abilene</H2>

<H4> 

Abilene, Abilene<BR>
Prettiest town I ever seen.<BR>
Folks down there don't treat you mean<BR>
In Abilene, my Abilene.<BR><BR>

I sit alone most every night<BR>
Watch them trains roll out of sight<BR>
Wish that they were carryin' me<BR>
To Abilene, my Abilene.<BR><BR>

Crowded city, ain't nothin' free<BR>
Nothin' in this town for me<BR>
Wish to God that I could be<BR>
In Abilene, my Abilene.<BR><BR>

How I wish that train would come<BR>
Take me back where I come from.<BR>
Take me where I want to be<BR>
In Abilene, my Abilene.<BR><BR>

Rotgut whiskey numbs the brain<BR>
If I stay here I'll go insane.<BR>
Think I need a change of scene<BR>
To Abilene, my Abilene.<BR><BR>

Outside my window cold rain falls,<BR>
Sit here starin' at the walls;<BR>
If I was home, I'd be serene<BR>
In Abilene, my Abilene.<BR><BR>
