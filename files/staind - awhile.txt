It's Been Awhile Lyrics
by Staind

Asus
It's been awhile 
C9             G5       D9
Since I could hold my head up high
And it's been awhile
Since I first saw you
And it's been awhile
Since I could stand on my own two feet again
And it's been awhile
Since I could call you

And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
And consequences that are rendered
I stretched myself beyond my means

And it's been awhile
Since I could say that I wasn't addicted 
And it's been awhile
Since I could say I loved my self as well as..
And it's been awhile
Since I've gone and fucked things up just like I always do
And it's been awhile
But all that shit seems to disappear when I'm with you

And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
And consequences that are rendered
I've gone and fucked things up again

Yeah....

Why must I feel this way?
Just make this go away
Just one more peaceful day

And it's been awhile
Since I could look at myself straight
And it's been awhile
Since I've said I'm sorry
And it's been awhile
Since I've seen the way the candles light your face
And it's been awhile
But I can still remember just the way you taste

And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all my seem
to me I know it's me
I cannot blame this on my father
He did the best he could for me

And it's been awhile
Since I could hold my head up high
And it's been awhile
Since I've said I'm sorry
