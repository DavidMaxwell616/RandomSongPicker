THE ONLY WAY
A7
swimming in a river 
through a jungle of bad dreams
C 
every night I’m reminded 
A7
of what i could have never been 
if that stain on the rug was able to speak
C
it would probably spread vicious lies 
      A7
about me
F	C 
and so I return to the place 
G
where escape is allowed
F                       A7
drunk on red death and thinking out loud

E	A9/G E
I found that the only way to believe you
D9 / F#
Is to leave you behind
E	A9/G E
I found the only way to leave you
D9/F#
is to be left behind

Sitting in a hotel room 
too sober to breathe 
looking for a reason 
to stay here or to leave 
laughter fades from her eyes 
and she starts to sigh 
I wake up to a nightmare and say goodbye
if I’m all alone or just trying to be 
she won’t let me know until she’s free

expect me to wait 
for a shoe that never drops 
start inciting a riot 
and then call the cops 
comfortless, between liberty and loss 
my career is a fetish, my lovelife a toss as time winded down 
to the last precious minute
the last drop of her love has a hair in it
