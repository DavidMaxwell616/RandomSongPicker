"Y'all pass me that bottle and I'll sing you all a real song." 

         G               C                    F             F#     G 
Well I'm looking through Harlem, my stomach squeals just a little more. 
     G                 C/E                           F        F#      G
A stagecoach full of feathers and footprints pulls up to my soapbox door. 
      B/F#                                   Em     Em/D     C     
Now a lady with a pearl handled necktie tied to the driver's fence 
G              Bb/F C/E                               C#dim Edim Gdim A#dim*
breathes in my face bourbon and coke possessed words, 
           G            B/F#     Em       Em/D   C        F   G
"Haven't I seen you somewhere in hell, or was it just an accident?" 

(play first two measures of intro and say)
"You know how I felt then" 

   G                        C                     F          F#       G 
Before I could ask was it a east or west side my feet they howled in pain. 
     G                     C/E                       F         F#          G
The wheels of a bandwagon cut very deep but not as deep in my mind as the rain 
    B/F#                                        Em        Em/D                C     
and as they pulled away I could see her words staggering falling on my muddy tent. 
        G              Bb/F                C/E                 C#dim Edim Gdim A#dim*
Well I picked them up, brushed them off to see what they said    - and you wouldn't believe .
        G           B/F#          Em          Em/D                       C            F   G
"Come around to my room with the tooth in the middle and bring along a bottle and a president."

Chorus
    B/F#                                  Em   Em/D      C     
And sometimes it's not so easy 'specially when your only friend 
G      B/F#            Em        Em/D      C           F           G 
talks, sees, looks and feels like you.And You do just the same as him.

(play intro and say)
"It gets very lonely out on this road baby"

           G             C          F       F#       G 
Well I'm riding through L.A. on a bicycle built for fools.
     G                     C/E                       F         F#          G
And I see one of my old buddies and he says "You don't look the way you used to do."  
            B/F#                                                  Em                    Em/D       C     
I say well "Some people look like a coin box." He says, "You look like you ain't got no coins to spare 
        G              Bb/F      C/E       C#dim Edim Gdim A#dim*
And I lay back and I thought to myself        And I said this 
        G           B/F#            Em            Em/D                   C           F         G
I just picked up my pride from underneath the pay phone and combed his breath right out of my hair.

>Chorus

            G                     C                  F           F#       G 
I just got out of a Scandinavian jail and I'm on my way straight home to you 
       G                      C/E                               F              F#           G
but I feel so dizzy I take a quick look in the mirror to make sure my friends here with me too. 
        B/F#                                        Em         Em/D      C     
And you know good well I don't drink coffee so you fill my cup full of sand 
          G    Bb/F         C/E       
and the frozen TV's on the barroom 
        G        Bb/F              C/E       
Cherry lipstick around the broken edge 
        G            Bb/F         C/E       
and my coat that you let your dog lay by the fire on. 
          G            Bb/F                   C/E       
And your cat he attacks me from his pill box ledge 
          G               Bb/F    C/E       
and I thought you were my friend too 
          G            Bb/F         C/E       
man my shadow comes in line before you. 
                               B/F#                    Em       Em/D   C     
I'm finding out that it's it's not so easy 'specially when your only friend
        G     B/F#       Em        Em/D         C            F       G 
talks, looks, sees, and feels like you. And You do just the same as him.

G     B/F#       Em        Em/D         C            F       G
