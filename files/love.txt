LOVE LOST BY MAX

Though I shouldn't remember who we were
I cannot forget your face
Through the fog that keeps my dreams at bay
Your laughs I cannot replace
My path has gotten narrower
as people fade into the night
when I'm losing my grip
your smile still soothes my fright
and I'm standing not alone someone is near
They are so close I'm deafened by my fear
You may not be just right for me
You're still the one I need
I'm still waiting for the sun to burn away my haze
So I can stop compromise, rationalise
and start to smile again
then we can both laugh again
two innocents in love
just to taste that thrill of freedom again
I must triumph from above
