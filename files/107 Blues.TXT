Gonna take a fifth of Old Weller just to set me free

(Feelin's gettin' low now just about over my head)2X
Thank you Lord, I can drown in bourbon instead
(107 bourbon gonna clear my mind)2X
Gonna ease my head just like smokin' the kind

Hear me pound it now
You can hear my Old Weller howl
And if I drink too much brown
You're gonna see me go down

(Thing about whiskey blues, papa don't feel no pain)2X
It's the only kind of blues i'd sure like to feel again
(Gimme 107 bourbon  baby til I die)2X
If it comes sooner than later I'll sure know why
