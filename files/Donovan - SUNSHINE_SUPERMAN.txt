SUNSHINE SUPERMAN by Donovan

C7
Sunshine came softly through my a-window today
C7
Could've tripped out easy a-but I've a-changed my ways
F
It'll take time I know it but in a while
C7
You're gonna be mine I know it, we'll do it in style
G7                              F                 F
'Cause I made my mind up you're going to be mine, I'll tell you right now
C7
Any trick in the book now baby a-that I can find

Superman or Green Lantern ain't got a-nothin' on me
I can make like a turtle and dive for pearls in the sea
A-you-you-you can just sit there a-thinkin' on your velvet throne
'Bout all the rainbows a-you can a-have for your own
When you've made your mind up forever to be mine

Everybody's hustlin' just to have a little scene
When I say we'll be cool I think that you know what I mean
We stood on the beach at sunset, do you remember when?
I know a beach where baby a-it never ends
When you've made your mind up, forever to be mine
I'll pick up your hand and slowly blow your little mind

'Cause I made my mind up, you're going to be mine.
I'll tell you right now
Any trick in the book now baby a-that I can find.


I'll pick up your hand and slowly blow your little mind
When you've made your mind up, forever to be mine.
I'll pick up your hand and slowly blow your little mind
When you've made your mind up, forever to be mine.
