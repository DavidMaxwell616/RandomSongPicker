TENNESSEE BUDS BY JOHNNY SPLEEF

D
Along about 1825 
C
I found a seed of the Tennessee kind
D
I never would've ditched all my mexican mud 
                      Am        D   
if it wasn't for the Tennessee buds
I had some trouble with my sweetheart's paw 
he was undercover with the Tennessee law
I gave him funnels of pure suds and 
I escaped with the Tennessee buds

D
Tennessee Buds were fat and green
G                       A7sus   A7   
I did a backflip on the trampoline
D
He had the light and I had the club
                               Am        D
we smoked a fat spleef of the Tennessee buds

I got real drunk with the buds in my hand
I dropped a couple in the Rio Grande
I sat right down and a fatty I rolled
A guy wanted to trade me for some Colombian gold
I said "hey buddy, can't you see? 
the kindest buds come from Tennessee."
He took one toke and he fell with a *thud* 
and I got away with both of our buds

(chorus)

I was as high as a man could be
dreaming of my harvest in Tennessee
how those buds just grew and grew
I even made oil from the male plants too
I'll head back through Arkansas
I can harvest more buds by early this fall
They'll be so fat they'll be so kind
one bonghit will blow your mind

(chorus)

All the plants were side by side
in a 30 acre field across the mountainside
The beautiful field was a sight to see
and I ran through the field screaming "THC!"
I left a few pounds on the cabin floor
I didn't remember til I opened the door
I sure do love all this Tennessee weed
and I owe it all to the Tennessee seed
