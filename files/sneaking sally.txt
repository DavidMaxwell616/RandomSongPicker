SNEAKING SALLY THROUGH THE ALLEY
By Allen B. Toussaint

SNEAKING SALLY THROUGH THE ALLEY,
TRYIN' TO KEEP HER out of SIGHT.
SNEAKING SALLY THROUGH THE ALLEY,
when up pops the wife

I SAID, "I CAN'T FIND NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING FRIENDS, 'CAUSE SOMETIMES 
SHE LETS ME USE the CAR."
SHE SAID, "IF YOU CAN'T FIND NOTHING WRONG with YOUR MIND,
you better you better find something wrong with her

SO I BEGAN TO TRY to EXPLAIN,
That IT JUST WASN'T, just WASN'T what you THOUGHT.
now I better find something to do with my time
the fact is lord I just BEEN CAUGHT.

SNEAKING SALLY THROUGH THE ALLEY,
TRYIN' TO GET AWAY clean.
SNEAKING WITH SALLY THROUGH THE ALLEY,
ohhh when up pops the queen

Tryin to TALK DOUBLE TALK,
get myself in TROUBLE TALK.
CATCHING MYSELF IN LIES.
CATCH MYSELF IN LIES.
MAMA, JUST LOOK AT ME, crazy
THINKING ABOUT KILLING ME,
I SAW IT IN HER EYES.

SHE CAUGHT ME SNEAKING WITH SALLY THROUGH THE ALLEY,
TRYIN' TO KEEP HER FROM SIGHT.
I WAS SNEAKING WITH SALLY THROUGH THAT ALLEY,
MY BABY CAUGHT ME LAST NIGHT.

WELL, I WAS SNEAKING SALLY THROUGH THAT ALLEY,
TRYIN' TO GET AWAY CLEAN. 
YOU KNOW, SNEAKING WITH SALLY WITHOUT KNOWING,
MY BABY SAW THE WHOLE SCENE.

(Oh, oh, oh)

AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED, MAN?
SHE GOT RIGHT UP TO ME ONE MORE TIME, 
SHE SAID,
"WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THE ALLEY WITH THAT SALLY?"
I SAID,
"YOU'LL JUST WAIT TILL TOMORROW AND WE'LL TALK!"
