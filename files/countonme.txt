COUNT ON ME

A             E     
precious love I can reuse
D               F#                      Bm       E
blue as the sky deep in the eyes of her love so true
A               E          
beautiful face you make me feel 
D                 F#                     Bm       E
light in my steps lost in the air of our love so real

        A     D  E
you can count on me
        A     D      E
you can count on my love
            A
to see you through

every light i try to refuse
caught on the wheels lost in the fields of her love
so soon
ruby lips you make a song into the night 
sleep by the light of a love so strong

COUNT ON ME
JEFFERSON STARSHIP
(Jesse Barish)

Precious love
I'll give it to you
Blue as the sky and deep in the
Eyes of a love so true
Beautiful face
You make me feel
Lite on the stairs and lost in the
Air of a love so real

And you can count on me girl
You can count on my love
Woman
You can count on me baby
You can count on my love to see
You through

Emerald eyes and China perfume
Caught in the wheel and lost in
The feel of a love so soon
Ruby lips
You make my song
Into the night and saved by the lite
Of a love so strong

Chorus: See you thru
....Oooh
You can count on me girl
You can count on my love
