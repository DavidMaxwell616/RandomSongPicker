[Am]                              F             E
When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful,
   G                 F           F#dim 
a miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical.
            Am                                  F          E  
And all the birds in the trees, well they'd be singing so happily,
     G              F         F#dim
oh, joyfully, oh, playfully, watching me.


But then they sent me away, to teach me how to be sensible,
logicalm oh, responsible practical.
And they showed me a world where I could be so dependable,
oh, clinical, oh, intellectual, cynical.


           C                             C6  
There are times when all the world's asleep,
                      F                      Bb     Dm    Gm  Dm
the questions run too deep for such a simple man 
           C                                C6  
Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned?
                   F                           Bb     Dm    Gm  Dm
I know it sounds absurd. Please tell me who I am.     

    

I said, now watch what you say or they'll be calling you a radical,
a liberal, oh fanatical, criminal.
Oh, won't you sign up your name, we'd like to feel you're acceptable,
respectable, oh, presentable, a vegetable!

At night, when all the world's asleep...

{c:Outro:}
F                           Bb     Dm    Gm  Dm
Please tell me who I am,                       
         Bb     Dm    Gm  Dm
who I am,
          Bb     Dm    Gm  Dm
who I am,

etc.
