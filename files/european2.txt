EUROPEAN ON MY PARADE
BY MAX

E      Bm               Am      C
Be not bloodied by the surf of sorrow
E      Bm               Am      C
wade valiantly into blind tomorrow
E      Bm               Am      C
overburdened with castrated pride
E      Bm               Am      C
forcefeeding logic with every stride
A    Am    D   E   
  recede from shore,
A    Am    D   E   
  succeed in war,
F#        C#m       B7        E
never to feel a surcease of sorrow

F#        C#m       B7        E

Sour milquetoast rattle your cage
turn your back on friends and decay of age
Empty purposes fuel your frenzy
snowblind rescuer of reasons you can't see
gaunt and sallow,
flaunting shallow
choke on bitter juice of rage

Pointless tirades line your brow
captive audiences sleeping now
even daybreak cannot bring you down
hollow dreamer stand your ground 
frowning in the dark
drowning dogs that bark
thumb the nose that taught you how

Dry as a fist and half as healthy
Velvet bludgeons cannot quell thee
waxing arrogant in a plastic shell
I'll rsvp to your private hell
forgotten mirror
Admit you fear her
Vacuous chimp, what cards you've dealt me

Lonely castaway, inevitable bore
unconscious talent, the rest ignored
left behind like a half empty beer 
self-guiling mystique, unquenchable leer
resort to ice cream
and prozac pipedream
Find your flagships now, you whore!
