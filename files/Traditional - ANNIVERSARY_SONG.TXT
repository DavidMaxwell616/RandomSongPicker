ANNIVERSARY SONG

B7                      Em
Oh how we danced on the night we were wed
   Am             Em            B7          Em
We vowed our true love though a word wasn't said
    B7                            Em
The world was in bloom there were stars in the skies
Am             Em            B7            Em
Except for the few that were there in your eyes

D9                    C           G
Dear as I held you so close in my arms
D7                    C            G
Angels were singing a hymn to your charms
    B7                         Em
Two hearts gently beating were murmuring low
    Am        B7       Em
"My darling I love you so"

B7                            Em
The night seemed to fade into blossoming dawn
    Am        Em           B7             Em
The sun shone anew but the dance lingered on
      B7                       Em
Could we but relive that sweet moment sublime
     Am            Em        B7         Em
We'd find that our love is unaltered by time
