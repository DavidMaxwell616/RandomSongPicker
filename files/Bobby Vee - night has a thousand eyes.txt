F                                  A7   D7
They say that you're a runaround lover
G7          C           F   G7  C7
Though you say it isn't so
F                            A7     D7
But if you put me down for another
G7
I'll know, believe me, I'll know

Dm7
'Cause the night has a thousand eyes
And a thousand eyes can't help but see
If you are true to me
So remember when you tell those little white lies
That the night has a thousand eyes

You say that you're at home when you phone me
And how much you really care
Though you keep tellin' me that you're lonely
I'll know if someone is there

'Cause the night has a thousand eyes
And a thousand eyes can't help but see
If you are true to me
So remember when you tell those little white lies
That the night has a thousand eyes

One of these days you're gonna be sorry
'Cause your game I'm gonna play
And you'll find out without really tryin'
Each time that I kiss astray

'Cause the night has a thousand eyes
And a thousand eyes will see me true
And no matter what I do
I could never disguise all my little white lies
'Cause the night has a thousand eyes
So remember when you tell those little white lies
That the night has a thousand eyes
