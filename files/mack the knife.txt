Mack the Knife
By Kurt Weil. From the 'Three Penny Opera'.
(I like to swing it)

            C6               Dm                         G7     C6
Well, the shark has pretty teeth dear, and he keeps them pearly white
           Am               Dm                        G7      C6
Just a jackknife has old MacHeath dear, and he keeps it out of sight

(Chord progression repeats through out song)

When the shark bites with his teeth dear, scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves though wears old MacHeath dear, so there's never a
Trace of red

Sunday morning on the sidewalk, lies a body oozing life
And some one's creeping around the corner, could that some one
Be Mack the knife?

>From a tug boat on the river a cement bag's dropping down
The cement's just for the weight dear, I bet you Macky's back in town

Louis Miller disappeared dear, after drawing all his cash
And old MacHeath spends like a sailor, did our boy do someting rash?

Suky Tawdry, Jenny Diver, Polly Peachum and old Lucy Brown
Well, the line forms on the right girls, now that Macky's back in town!
