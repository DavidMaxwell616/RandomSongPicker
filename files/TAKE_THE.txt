This here's a story about Billy Joe and Bobbie Sue 
Two young lovers with nothin' better to do 
Than sit around the house, get high, and watch the tube 
And here is what happened when they decided to cut loose 

They headed down to, ooh, old El Paso 
That's where they ran into a great big hassle 
Billy Joe shot a man while robbing his castle 
Bobbie Sue took the money and run 

Go on take the money and run 
Go on take the money and run 
Go on take the money and run 
Go on take the money and run 

Billy Mack is a detective down in Texas 
You know he knows just exactly what the facts is 
He ain't gonna let those two escape justice 
He makes his livin' off of the people's taxes 

Bobbie Sue, whoa, whoa, she slipped away 
Billy Joe caught up to her the very next day 
They got the money, hey 
You know they got away 
They headed down south and they're still running today 
Singin' go on take the money and run 
Go on take the money and run 
Go on take the money and run 
Go on take the money and run 
Go on take the money and run 
Go on take the money and run 
Go on take the money and run 
Go on take the money and run
