I like to dream right between my sound machine
on a cloud of sound, I drift in the night, 
any place it goes is right
goes far flies near to the stars away from here, 
Well you don't know what we can find, oh
why don't you come with me, little girl, 
on a magic carpet ride, 

well you don't know what we can see
why don't you tell your dreams to me, 
fantasy will set you free.
Close your eyes, girl 
look inside, girl
let the sound take you away.................

Last night I owned Alladin's lamp
and so I wished that I could stay 
before the thing could answer me
someone came & took the lamp away 
I looked around a lousy candle is all I found, 

well you don't know what we can find, 
oh why don't you come with me, little girl
on a magic carpet ride, 
well, you don't know what we can see 
why don't you tell your dreams to me
fantasy will set you free 
Close your eyes girl,
look inside girl 
let the sound take you away..........
