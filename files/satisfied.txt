Got The Blues Can't Be Satisfied

got the blues can't be satisfied 2X 
if the blues don't kill me gonna catch that train and ride
i got my gal a great big diamond ring 2X 
i took it right back caught her doin' that same old thing
honey what makes you treat your man this way 2X 
cause you know I wants anything you give away
grabbed my shotgun broke that barrel right down 2X  
i put my honey six feet under ground
cut that joker so long deep and wide 2X 
i still got the blues and I can't be satisfied
whiskey straight will drive my blues away 2X 
that bein the case I'll take a quart today
