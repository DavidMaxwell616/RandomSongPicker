Verse (chords on first two lines implied by guitar/bass riffs above):

	          (Fm)                                 (Bb)
	Girl, you thought you found the answer on that magic carpet ride last
	    (Fm)      (Bb)
	    night
	             (Fm)                       (Bb)
	But when you wake up in the mornin' the world still gets you
	      (Fm)     (Bb)
	    uptight
	         Db
	Well, here's nothin' that you ain't tried
	    Fm            /E    /Eb   /D
	To fill the emptiness inside
	     Db
	But when you come back down, girl
	                      C
	Still ain't feelin' right

Chorus:

	[1,2,4:  And don't it seem like]
	 Ab                      Db
	Kicks just keep gettin' harder to find
	    		[3, 4: Oh, you don't need kicks, girl]
	              Ab                  Db
	And all your kicks ain't bringin' you peace of mind
	    		[3, 4: You just need help, girl]
	            Ab
	Before you find out it's too late, girl
	                 C
	You better get straight

Link (over intro guitar/bass riffs, 2X):

	                  (Fm)      (Bb)
	No, but not with kicks
	              (Fm)        (Bb)
	You just need help, girl

Verse 2:

	Well you think you're gonna find yourself a little piece of
	    paradise
	But it ain't happened yet, so girl, you better think twice
	Don't you see no matter what you do
	You'll never run away from you
	And if you keep on runnin'
	You'll have to pay the price

	[repeat chorus]

Bridge:

	                    F
	No, you don't need kicks
	             Dm 
	To help you face the world each day
	               Bb
	That road goes nowhere
	           C
	I'm gonna help you find yourself another way

	[repeat chorus 2X; fade second time]
