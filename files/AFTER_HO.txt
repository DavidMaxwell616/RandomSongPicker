 This is a great VU song, sung by Mo Tucker and covered I understand by 
 REM. Play this on an acoustic and drop the tuning a half-step. 
 
 AFTERHOURS
 
 (1,2,3)
        C         A7
 If you close the door
     Dm7                  G
 The night could last forever
           C        A7
 Leave the sunshine out
     Dm7             G
 And say hello to never
 
 
 
         C                              C7
 All the people are talking and they're having such fun
   F                         Fm
 I wish this could happen to me
            C         A7
 But if you close the door
      Dm7            G            C
 I'll never have to see the day again

 
 
 
            C         A7
 But if you close the door
     Dm7                  G
 The night could last forever
           C          A7
 Leave the wine glass out
     Dm7               G
 And drink a toast to never
 
 
 C                           C7
 Someday I know someone will look into my eyes
            F
 And say hello
                        Fm
 You're my very special one
            C         A7
 But if you close the door
      Dm7            G           C        (Bass line to bridge: C-B-Bb)
 I'll never have to see the day again
 
 
 
 Bridge:
 
 Em         B7          Em       B7
 Dark party bars, shiny Cadillac cars
     Em        B7          Em        Em-D#-D       
 And people on subways and trains
         A7 
 Looking grey in the rain as they stand disarrayed
        Dm7                      G
 Oh but people look well in the dark

repeat First verse

     Dm7            G           C       A7
 I'll never have to see the day again (once more)
      Dm7            G           C
 I'll never have to see the day again
