Intro 
D  chord for the first eight bars

D                      G7
The lunatic is on the grass
D 		     G7	
The lunatic is on the grass
D                       E
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
A7			      D
Got to keep the loonies on the path.

D		  G7
The lunatic is in the hall
D		       G7
The lunatics are in my hall
D			      E
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
        A7			   D      D7
And every day the paperboy brings more


G			    A
And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
    C                            G      
And if there is no room upon the hill
			      A7
And if your head explodes with dark forbodings too
     C        	                      G	
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.

Bm  Em      A 
aaaaaahhhhhhhhhh

D		   G7
The lunatic is in my head
D		   G7
The lunatic is in my head
D		    E
You raise the blade, you make the change
A7		            D	
You rearrange me till I'm sane
D		       E
You lock the door and throw away the key
             A7                         D    D7
There's someone in my head but it's not me

G	    		A
And if the cloud bursts thunder in your ear
C			       G	
You shout and no one seems to hear
			         A7
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes
     C			           G
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

For the rest of the song it plays the same chord progression as in the
verses
and then it goes into the song "Eclipse"
