EUROPEAN ON MY PARADE

E       Bm              Am       C  
Be not bloodied in the surf of sorrow
E       Bm        Am       C  
wade valiantly into blind tomorrow
A   Am    D    E
  recede from shore,
A      Am    E   
cower even more,
F#m    C#7      B7         E 
never feel a surcease of sorrow

F#m    C#7      B7   C7   E 

Sour milquetoast rattle your cage
turn your back on your friends and age
gaunt and sallow,
beyond the shadow
choke on bitter juice of rage

Pointless tirades line your brow
captive audiences sleeping now
frown in the dark

thumb the nose that taught you how

Dry as a fist and half as wealthy
Velvet bludgeons cannot quell thee
forgotten mirror
Admit you fear her
Vacuous chimp, what cards you've dealt me

Bridge:

(F#  D  B)4x

Alone and forgotten, invariable bore
comatose skill, the rest ignored
wheelchair ice cream
prozac pipedream
Find your flagships now, you whore!
