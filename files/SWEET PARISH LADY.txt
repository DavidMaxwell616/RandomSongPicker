SWEET PARISH LADY

C              G        C         G
It's Christmas time and I have no lime, 
  C             G          C             G  
I had a rum and coke but I didn't have a dime.
  Dm                        F                        
I drank that drink down and stumbled to the street
  E                                   C 
I met a lady who was to your mother's knees. 

She was a sweet parish lady  she took me upstairs,
she didn't give me tady she gave me a dime's worth
of the kind. 

With the papers I had the Christmas tree
too we soon had a fire and New England did approve.
We stayed around by the fire all night long.

There was a sweet parish lady she gave me a dime
it wasn't worth the kind bud but it came in its time.
You had a driver's license too. 

I would spend it on you if you weren't such a fool
you're ugly and stupid and you smell bad too.
You've got a problem with your size. 

You can get a pair of glasses anytime. 
I'll be waiting for you at a quarter of nine.
Oh hooo- you can't have a Christmas when you're blue.

   Am                           G 
   Wait for my signal if you're smart
   Am                    G
   You will find I never fart

I'm an artistic guy I leave in the morning and I get
home at five I get drunk all the time but you'll
never guess why 

It's the Christmas season and those
tacky Santas they make me blue I get drunk as a 
phantom you know those phantoms get drunk too ooh.

You can't count my change on my left arm. 
I'll give you a monkey if you don't do me Hiram.
Let's end this song soon. 
I married Brenda Wiley
