C
You're breakin' my heart
        G
You're tearin' it apart
        C
So fuck you
All I want to do
    G
Is have a good time
    C      
Now I'm blue
     F
You wanna boogaloo
Run down to Tramps
 D                    G
Have a dance or two--ooh!
You're breaking my heart
You're tearin' it apart
But fuck you
You're breakin' my heart
You're tearin' it apart
Ooh!--ooh!--
You stepped on my ass
You're breaking my glasses too
You wanna drive my car
Buy a lot of stuff
I've had enough
Of you--ooh!
I'm goin' insane
There's no one to blame
So fuck you
You've gotta have your way
There's nothin' left to say
There's nothin' left to do--ooh!
You're breakin' my heart
You're tearin' it apart
So fuck you
You've gotta have your way
There's nothin' left to say
There's nothin' left to do--ooh!
You're breakin' my heart
You're tearin' it apart
But I love you
(Do-do-doots)
