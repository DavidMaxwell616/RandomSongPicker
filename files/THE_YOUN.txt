The Young Ones             Cliff Richard and the Shadows
==============

 G     Em     Am     D7

    G
The young ones
                  Em
darling we're the young ones
        G
and the young ones
             Em
shouldn't be afraid
   G       D7
to live    love
G                  C
while the flame is strong
         G              D7
cause we may not be the young ones,
     G
very long.


  G
Tomorrow
                 Em
Why wait until tomorrow
         G
'cause tomorrow
                Em
sometimes never comes
   G        D7
so love     me
G                    C
There's a song to be sung
        G            D7
and the best time to sing it
               G     G7
is while we're young.


Chorus:
C                       C *
Once in every life time
G                     G *
Comes a love like this
    A7          /
Oh, I need you, you need me
D             D7
Oh my darling can you see


    G
The young dreams
                  Em
should be dreamed together
          G
And young hearts
             Em
shouldn't be afraid
    G       D7
And some    day
G                   C
when the years have flown
             G               D7
Darling then we'll teach the young ones
       G   G7
of our own.
