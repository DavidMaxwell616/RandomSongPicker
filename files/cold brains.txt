  Cold Brains, unmoved, untouched, unglued,

  alone at last 
D       A         G       C      D
  no thoughts, no mind to rot behind 
    A           G      G7 G6 
  a trail of disasters 

A        D     F         A
a final curse abandoned hearse

we ride disowned corroded to the bone

the fields of green are bent, obscene
i lay upon the gravel 
a worm of hope a hangman's rope 
pulls me one way or the other 

a final curse abandoned hearse
we write this song corroded to the bone

harmonica "solo"

a bird of song is heard no longer 
in the evacuated heavens 
the drain is drawn and drained and gone 
and on and on, it doesn't matter 

a final curse abandoned hearse
we ride disowned corroded to the bone

harmonica "solo", fade
