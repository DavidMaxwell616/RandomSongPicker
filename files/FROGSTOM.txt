ISRAEL'S SON

Hate is what I feel for you,
And I want you to know that I want you dead.
You're late for the execution,
If you're not here soon, I'll kill your friend instead.

All the pain I feel, you're wounds start to heal.
All the while I like it, oh.

I hate you, I've no apathy
You can leave, you can leave, I don't want you here.
I'm there in this pantomime,
But I don't see a show and the signs of "fair".

All the pain I feel, you're wounds start to heal.
All the while I like it, oh.
This time I'm for real, my thinking of you,
You will be there when I'm there, oh.

Hate is what I feel for you,
And I want you to know that I want you dead.
You're late for the execution,
If you're not here soon, I'll get a friend instead.

All the pain I feel, you're wounds start to heal.
All the while I like it, oh.
This time I'm for real, my thinking of you,
You will be there when I'm through, oh.

Hate and execution.
Put your hands in the air!
Put your hands in the air!
Yeah...

Aaaah!!!

I am I am Israel's son, Israel's son I am.
Put your hands in the air!
Put your hands in the air!
I am I am Israel's son, Israel's son I am.
Put your hands in the air!
Put your hands in the air!
Aaaah!!! 
Yeah!!!!!!!!


TOMORROW

It's twelve o'clock and it's a wonderful day.
I know you hate me, but I'll ask anyway...
Won't you come with me, to a place in a little town?
The only way to get there is to go straight down.

There's no bathroom, and there is no sink
The water out of the tap is very...
Hard to drink...
Very hard to drink...

Ooh! Wait till tomorrow
Ooh! Wait till tomorrow

You say the money isn't everything
But I'd like to see you live without it
You think you can keep on going living like a king
ooh, babe well I strongly doubt it

Very hard to drink...
Very hard to drink...

You gonna wait till, fat boy,
Fat boy, wait till tomorrow.
You gonna wait till, fat boy,
Fat boy, wait till tomorrow.

Ooh! Wait till tomorrow
Ooh! Wait till tomorrow

You gonna wait, fat boy,
Fat boy, wait till tomorrow.
You gonna wait, fat boy,
Fat boy, wait till tomorrow.

ooh...

FAULTLINE

Unsuspecting brother, doesn't know what to do,
When everything just falls to the ground.
He runs to find some cover, he doesn't have a clue,
That his friend will never be found,
When he's informed
That he...

Will never see the boy,
Will never see the boy,
Will never see him open his eyes.
We'll never see the boy,
Never see the boy,
We'll only hear his heavenly cries...
ooh yeah ... ooh.
oooooohh ... ooooohhhh

Thinking of the past, it's all over now
Will mother nature strike once again?
It happened oh so fast, now the question's how...
How could they let that building descend?
ooh yeah ... ooh.

Will never see the boy,
Will never see the boy,
Will never see him open his eyes.
You'll never see the boy,
Never see the boy,
You'll only hear his heavenly cries...
ooh yeah ... ooh.
oooooohh ... ooooohhhh

Yeah... no, no, no, no........

While still you're alive, I live, I'm dead,
Leaving me all through the night.
Once he's born again, I need you to find...
Need you to find, where he is!


PURE MASSACRE

People, dying, for no reason.
It is no difference, or if you're large or small.

Families been torn apart,
Doesn't have to be this way.
Some people just have no heart,
It's happening every day...

Pure Massacre!! Pure Massacre!!
Pure Massacre!! Pure Massacre!!

Machine guns pumping, hearts thumping,
Death is all around.
People crying for freedom,
Noone hears a sound.

Pure Massacre!! Pure Massacre!!
Pure Massacre!! Pure Massacre!!

There's people crying,
There's people dying.
But someone's taking
It all...

Yeah!!

Machine guns pumping, hearts thumping,
Death is all around.
People crying for freedom,
Noone hears a sound.

Pure Massacre!! Pure Massacre!!
Pure Massacre!! Pure Massacre!!
Pure Massacre!! Pure Massacre!! Yeah!
Pure Massacre!! Pure Massacre!!

It's gonna be a Pure Massacre. Yeah!!!


SHADE

If you're hurt, why don't you tell someone?
Don't feel bad, you're not the only one.

Don't go hiding, hiding, in the shade.
Don't go hiding, hiding, in the shade.

If you were abused, I found someone to help you.
I know you were used, what are ya gonna do? Yeah...

Don't go hiding, hiding, in the shade.
Don't go hiding, hiding, in the shade.

Don't go hiding, hiding, in the shade.
Don't go hiding, hiding, in the shade.
Hiding! Hiding!
Don't go! Hiding! Hiding! Hiding! In the shade! Yeah,
In the shade! In the, in the shade! In the shade!
In the shade!
In the shade....


LEAVE ME OUT

Oh, you can lead us round, 
But I'm something you don't own. hmm...
Greed is a sin, 
So don't leave me in. ooh...

You can leave me out, yeah.
Leave me out.
Leave me out.
oh... yeah!

You can leave me out, yeah.
Leave me out.
Leave me out.
oh... yeah!

Yeah! oh. oh... ah... oh...

You can leave me out, yeah.
Leave me out.
Leave me out.
oh.. yeah!

SUICIDAL DREAM

I dream about, how it's gonna end,
Approaching me quickly.
Living a life of fear,
I only want my mind to be clear.
People making fun of me,
For no reason but jealousy.
I fantasise about my death,
I kill myself from holding my breath...

My suicidal dream...
Voices telling me what to do,
My suicidal dream...
I'm sure you will get your's too...

Help me, comfort me,
Stop me from feeling, what I'm feeling now!
The rope is here, now I'll find a use,
I'll kill myself, I'll put my head in the noose.

My suicidal dream...
Voices telling me what to do,
My suicidal dream...
I'm sure you will get your's too...

Dreamin' about my death,
Dream...

Suicidal! Suicidal! Suicidal Dream.
My suicidal, suicidal dream!


UNDECIDED

Ooh, There's no time to choose for yourself,
It's like the candle's lit at both ends now,
Did Syria rain in filth?
Parents breaking up. Wish they would decide
Whether the two of them together,
Can make up their mind.

They wonder why you need someone, 
You get no freedom at all.
They want you to drop down and conform,
They make your self-esteem fall,

Undecided. Can't make up their mind.
Her parents were lying, they've left you behind.

If there's a lock to their minds, can you tell me please?
I wanna stay, stay to get the keys.

Undecided. Can't make up their mind.
Her parents were lying, they've left you behind.

Her mother doesn't even know her name, undecided.
If there is trouble she just gives up yeah, but denies it.

Undecided. Can't make up their mind.
Her parents were lying, they've left you behind.

Undecided, undecided.
Undecided, undecided.
ooh!


CICADA

When he was just a little boy,
He only had one favourite toy.
And he had nothing on his mind,
He never left anything behind, no...

As he got older things got worse,
Like he'd been born under a curse.
Things started to fall apart,
Well would life be well at the start? no...

It's like a civil war, 
Growing up! It's like a civil war, 
Don't turn away, it's something you can't ignore,
Growing up - it's like a civil war!

And now that he was in his jeans,
He started to live what life means.
Problems still appearing,
They didn't look like disappearing, no...

It's like a civil war, 
Growing up! It's like a civil war, 
Don't turn away, it's something you can't ignore,
Growing up!

Growing up! It's like a civil war,
Don't turn away, it's something you can't ignore,
Growing up! It's like a civil war, 
Don't turn away, it's something you can't ignore,
Growing up - it's like a civil war!


FINDAWAY

You've been locked up, and needed to escape,
You proved to all it was a first offence.
A drug addiction subtracting all your priviliges,
Giving up just makes no sense.

We'll findaway
We'll findaway
Don't give in, don't give in.
Don't give in, don't give in.

All you can think about is breaking free,
You can make it on your own.
You're thinking negative, nothing can go right,
It's eatin' you down to the bone!

We'll findaway
We'll findaway
Don't give in, don't give in.
Don't give in, don't give in.

ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

We'll findaway
We'll findaway
Don't give in, don't give in.
Don't give in, don't give in. ooh!!
