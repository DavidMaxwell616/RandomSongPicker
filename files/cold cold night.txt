 Song: In The Cold, Cold, Night Lyrics 

Dm F G A
 
 
Dm            F               G        A
   I saw you standing in the corner
Dm            F       G        A
   On the edge of a burning light
Dm            F               G        A
   I saw you standing in the corner
               G                       Dm    F
   Come to me again in the cold, cold night        
G         A          Dm     F  G  A
   In the cold, cold night
 
You make me feel a little older
Like a full grown woman might
But when you're gone I grow colder
come to me again in The Cold, Cold, Night
in the cold, cold night

I see you walking by my front door
I hear the creaking of the kitchen floor
I don't care what other people say
I'm going to love you, anyway
Come to me again in the cold, cold night
in the cold, cold night

I can't stand it any longer
I need the fuel to make my fire burn bright
So don't fight it any longer
Come to me again in the cold, cold night
In the cold, cold night

And I know that you feel it too
When my skin turns into glue
You will know that it's warm inside
And you'll come runnin' to me, in the cold, cold night
in the cold, cold night
in the cold, cold night
in the cold, cold night
