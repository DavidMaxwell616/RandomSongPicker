BANK MACHINE

A                               D   
Friday night and your cash is low,
A                               F#m7 
Guess there's only one place to go,
E                    Esus4
before you hear the music,
E                     Esus4
before your make the scene,
             E       F#m7  
you need to get some green

E              C# 
Wallet's empty need some ca-hash,
F#m7                    B7
Go spend sixty bucks in a flash
     D                 Bm7
Ohoo meet some girls, buy them drinks
        A 
Hit the bank machine

Everybody's there in line
the homeless doorman's drunk on wiiiine
Think about the future how much will you need
to have a swinging time?

And then you step inside, up to the bank machine
withdraw some green what the hell's my PIN? (oh, yeah)
