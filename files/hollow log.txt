HOLLOW LOG BY BECK
tune down 1 1/2 step


Lyrics: 

go where you want to 
do the things you feel 
walk around with a broken leg 
and a hundred dollar bill 

get yourself a pistol 
get yourself a dog 
stay up all night gettin' drunk 
sleepin' on a hollow log 

walk till your restless 
sleep till your tired 
wake up with that (thinking?) 
your the one that I desire
