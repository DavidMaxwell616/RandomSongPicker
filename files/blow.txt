BLOW WIND BLOW BY DR. JOHN

Blow wind Blow, all my troubles away
Blow wind Blow, until judgement day

you got my ring and everything
though you are to blame
where can I go, where can I turn
I'm walking in the rain

chorus

my head is hung way down low
made my poor heart yearn
you make me sad, I feel so bad
the way that this all turned

chorus

bridge

chorus

chorus
