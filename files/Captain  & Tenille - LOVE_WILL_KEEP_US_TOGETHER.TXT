LOVE WILL KEEP US TOGETHER

Love, love will keep us together
Think of me babe, whenever
Some sweet talking guy comes along, singing his song,
Don't mess around, you just gotta be strong
Just Stop - 'cause I really love you,
Stop - I'll be thinking of you,
Look in my heart and let love keep us together.

You, you belong to me, now
Ain't gonna set you free, now
When those guys start hanging around, talking me down,
Hear with your heart and you won't hear a sound
Just stop - 'cause I really love you,
Stop - I'll be thinking of you,
Look in my heart and let love keep us together, whatever.

Young and beautiful, but someday your looks will be gone.
When the others turn you off, who'll be turning you on?
I will, I will, I will, I will -

Be there to share forever
Love will keep us together
I've said it before and I'll say it again,
When others pretend,
I'll need you now and I'll need you then
Just Stop - 'cause I really love you
Stop - I'll be thinking of you
Look in my heart and let love keep us together, whatever.
I will, I will, I will, I will....
