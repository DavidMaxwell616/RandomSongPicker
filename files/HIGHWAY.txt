Intro: G7

G7
Well, I'm walkin' down the highway with my suitcase in my hand

           C7                               G7
Yes, I'm a-walkin' down the highway with my suitcase in my hand

        D7                   C7                    G7
Lord, I really miss my baby, she's in some foreign land


Well, your streets are getting empty, Lord, your highway's getting filled
And your streets are getting empty, and your highway's getting filled
Well, the way I love that woman, I swear it's bound to get me killed

Well, I've been gamblin' so long, Lord, I ain't got much more to lose
Yes I've been gamblin' so long, I ain't a-got much more to lose
Right now i'm having troubles, pleas don't take away my highway shoes

Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby, or I'm bound to die tryin'
Yes I'm bound to get lucky, Lord, I'm a-bound to die tryin'
Well meet me in the middle of the ocean and we'll leave this 
old highway behind

Well, the ocean took my baby, my baby stole my heart from me
Yes the ocean took my baby, my baby took my heart from me
She packed it all up in a suitcase, Lord she took it away to Italy Italy

Well, I'm a-walkin down your highway, just as far as my poor eyes can see
Yes I'm a-walkin down your highway, just as far as my eyes can see
From the Golden Gate bridge, all the way to the Statue of Liberty
