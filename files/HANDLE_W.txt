HANDLE WITH CARE by The Travelling Wilburys

D  C  G
D         C       G
Been beat up and battered around
D        C           G
Been set up and I've been shut down
C                          G      Em
You're the best thing that I ever found
C      D       G
Handle me with care

Reputations changable,        
situations tolerable 
But baby you're adorable
Handle me with care

         G     B7       C     D
        I'm so tired of being lonely 
         G      B7        C       D
        I still have some love to give
         G        B7      C        D      G
        Won't you show me that you really care
             C                      G
        Everybody's got somebody to lean on
                 C                     D
        Put your body next to mine and dream on

I've been fucked up and I've been fooled 
I've been robbed and ridiculed
In daycare centers and night schools
Handle me with care

D   C   G    D   C   G

Been stuck in airports terrorized,        
Sent to meetings hypnotized 
Overexposed commercialized
Handle me with care

CHORUS

I've been uptight and made a mess        
But I'm cleaning up myself I guess
Oh the sweet smell of success
Handle me with care
