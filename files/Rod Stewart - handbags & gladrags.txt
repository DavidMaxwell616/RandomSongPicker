1.    Ever seen a blind man cross the road, 
      D                                   G      - F - C - D
    trying to reach the other side ?
G                       F                           C
    Ever seen a young girl growing old 
      D                                    G      - F - C - D
    trying to make herself a bride ? 
e                                    D
   So what becomes of you my love,
G                                         A
    when they have finally stripped you of
            C
    the handbags and the gladrags
                      D                                                   G      
    that your poor old Grandad had to sweat to buy you.

2.     Once I was a young man 
C                                D                       G    - F - C - D
    and all I thought I had to do was smile.
G                           F
    You are still a young girl, 
C                             D                   G       - F - C - D
    and you bought everything in style.
e                                            D
    But once you think you're in, you're out,
G                                          A
    'cause that don't mean a single thing without
            C
    the handbags and the gladrags
                     D                                                    G 
    that your poor old Grandad had to sweat to buy.

3.    Sing a song of six-pence for your sake, 
                        D               G    - F - C - D
    and take a bottle full of rye.
G                               F                    C
    Four and twenty blackbirds in a cake, 
             D                         G     - F - C - D
    and bake them all in a pie.
e                                                D
   They told me you missed school today,
G                                                A
    so what I suggest you just throw them all away
            C
    the handbags and the gladrags
                     D                                                     G
    that your poor old Granddad had to sweat to buy.
