Dead Melodies 

capo 5th fret, arpeggiating chords

G D C Em E Am D G D D7

G              D        C          Em E 
where will you go when this day is over
  Am        D      G           D   D7
a gambler's purse lays on the road
Em 
straight to your door
A                        D    
snakes have gone crazy tonight
Dm             Am          D    D7
winding their way out of sight 

a laugh, a joke a sentiment wasted
seasons of strangers they've come and gone
doldrums are pounding,
cheapskates are clowning this town
who could disown themselves now 

engineer, slow down this old train
cinders and chaff laugh at the moon
night birds will cackle
rotting like apples on trees
Dm             Am       D        A7
sending their dead melodies...to me
