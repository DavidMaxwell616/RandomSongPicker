Hi,

First off I would like to thank you for providing this service.  I had
all but given up on playing when I found this resource. This fresh input
has revived my love.

I noticed a request for Sledgehammer in the most-wanted list.  I found
the following crd for this at another site.  The originators address is
at the top. I attempted to contact him/her to see if they minded me
forwarding this to you  but couldn't get mail through to that address. I
kinda figured if it was in a public ftp directory they might not mind it
being spread around.  I am sending the file intact incase you or anyone
else wishes to attempt to contact him/her.

Again thanks for being there and doing all this for all of us.

Regards,

Christopher Martin (cmartin@martin.idi.oclc.org)

You could have a steam train
                       Eb Db/Eb, Eb Db/Eb

If you'd just lay down your tracks
Ab/Eb         Eb  Db/Eb            Eb

If you'd bring your blue skies back
Ab/Eb          Eb   Db/Eb           Eb 

All you do is call me
Db/Eb         Cm          

I'll be anything you need
                          Eb Db/Eb, Eb

You could have a big dipper
Going up and down, all around the bends
You could have a bumper car, bumping
This amusement never ends

I want to be           your sledgehammer
          Cm Db,    Fm

I want to be your sledgehammer
Why don't you call my name
You'd better call me sledgehammer

Let there be no doubt about it

   Sledge.... sledge.... sledgehammer

I get it right!
I've kicked the habit (kicked the habit, kicked the habit)
Shed my skin (shed my skin)
This is the new stuff (this is the new stuff)
I go dancing in (we go dancing in)
Won't you show for me (show for me)
And I will show for you (show for you)
Please, show for me (show for me), I will show for you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I do mean you
Only you
You've been coming through
I'm going to build that power
Build, build up that power, 
I've been feeding the rhythm
I've been feeding the rhythm
Going to feel that power, yeah, build in you
Come on, come on, help me through
come on, come on, help me through
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you

I've been feeding the rhythm
It's what we're doing, doing
All day and night
