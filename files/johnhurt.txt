MISSISSIPPI JOHN HURT

Monday Morning Blues-A blues

(I woke up this morning)3X
with the Monday morning blues
(I couldn't hardly find)3X
my monday morning shoes
(Monday morning blues)3X
searchin all through my bones
(Monday morning blues)3X
made me leave my home
(I been laying in jail)3X
six long weeks today
(but tomorrow morning)3X
gonna be my trying day
(well I asked the jury)3X
what might be my fine
(get a pick and shovel)3X
let's go down in the mine
(that's the only time)3X
I ever felt like crying
(My heart struck sorrow)3X
and the tears come rolling down
(woke up this morning)3X
with the Monday morning blues
