JOE BALL'S TAVERN

Am         C  G          D9           Am     
one dusty day I heard a tavernkeeper say
it's takes too long to find the one who wants to stay
I looked around and saw confusion hidden in your smile
fuzzy mind and hidden secrets hidden not far behind

F          E             Am           G
impact of disbelief is stifling my diplomacy
joey ball will take them all and feed the gators in privacy
Sitting back and listening to the alligator sing
and that ring on your finger is stolen baby

Dm E
