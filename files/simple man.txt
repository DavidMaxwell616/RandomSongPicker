Simple Man

C G Am

Mama told me when I was young:
Sit beside me, my only son,
and listen closely to what I say
and if you do this it will help you some sunny day.

'Oh, take your time, don't live too fast.
Troubles will come and they will pass.
Go find a woman and you'll find love
and don't forget, son, there is someone up above.'

     'And be a simple kind of man,
     oh, be something you love and understand.
     Baby, be a simple kind of man.
     Oh, won't you do this for me, son, if you can.'

'Forget your lust for the rich man's gold,
all that you need is in your soul.
And you can do this if you try.
All that I want for you, my son, is to be satisfied.'

CHORUS

'Boy, don't you worry, you'll find yourself.
Follow your heart and nothing else.
And you can do this, oh baby, if you try.
All that I want for you, my son, is to be satisfied.'

CHORUS
