TITLE: Colours



Yellow is the color of my true love's hair
In the morning, when we rise
In the morning, when we rise
That's the time
     That's the time
That's the time
     That's the time
I love the best

Green is the color of the sparkling corn
In the morning, when we rise...

Blue is the color of the sky-y-y
In the morning...

Mellow is the feeling that I get
When I see her, hm-m
When I see her, oh, yeah
That's the time...

Freedom is a word I rarely use
Without thinking, oh yeah
Without thinking, hm-m
Of the time
     Of the time
Of the time
     Of the time
When I've been loved

Yellow is the color of my true love's hair
In the morning...
