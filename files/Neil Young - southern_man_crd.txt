SOUTHERN MAN

Dm  Bb  Gm  Dm  Bb  Bm

Dm                 Fmaj7/C
Southern man, better keep your head,

Bb                    G7
don't forget what your Good Book says.

Dm                 Fmaj7/C
Southern change gonna come at last,

Bb                  G7               Dm
now your crosses are burnin' fast, southern man.

Bb  Gm  Dm  Bb  Gm

Dm              Bb       Gm
I saw cotton and I saw black,

Dm                     Bb            Gm
tall white mansions and little shacks;

Dm                        Bb          Gm
southern man when will you pay them back?

A
I heard screamin' and bull whips crackin'.

How long, how long? Ah!

Dm  Bb  Gm  Dm  Bb  Bm

Southern man, better keep your head,
don't forget what your Good Book says.
Southern change gonna come at last,
now your crosses are burnin' fast, southern man.
Lillie Bell, your hair is golden brown,
I've seen your black man comin' round,
swear by God, I'm gonna cut him down!
I heard screamin' and bull whips crackin'.
How long, how long? Ah!

(Repeat and fade)

Dm  Bb  Gm  Dm  Bb  Gm
