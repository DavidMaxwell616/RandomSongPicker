                       SHOW ME THE WAY       PETER FRAMPTON



VERSE
D
I wonder how you're feeling there's ringing in my ears.
Bm                           Bb
And no one to relate to 'cept the sea.
D
Who can I believe in ?   I'm  kneeling on the floor.
Bm
There has to be a force.  Who do I phone ?
    A7sus4                            G7
The stars are out and shining.  But all I really want to know

Chorus
   Bm                    G
Oh won't you show me the way
       Bm              G    A7sus4
I want you show me the way

Verse

D
Well, I can see no reason.. you living on your nerves
     Bm                     Bb
When someone drop a cup and I submerge
D
I'm swimming in a circle ... I feel I'm going down
      Bm                   Bb
There has to be a fool to play my part
A7sus4                                  G7

Someone thought of healing..  But all I really want to know

Chorus

Instrumental D  Bm  Bb
D
I wonder if I'm dreaming  I feel so unashamed
  Bm                                 Bb
I can't believe this is happening to me.
A7sus4
I watch you when you're sleeping
           G7
And then I want to take your love
