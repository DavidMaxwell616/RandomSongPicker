Legalize It

A G

 Legalize it don't criticize it 
Legalize it and I will advertise it 
Some call it tampee 
Some call it the weed 
Some call it Marijuana 
Some of them call it Ganja 
(Repeat chorus) 
Singers smoke it 
And players of instruments too 
Legalize it, yeah, yeah 
That's the best thing you can do 
Doctors smoke it 
Nurses smoke it 
Judges smoke it 
Even the laywers too 
(Repeat chorus) 
It's good for the flu 
It's good for asthma 
Good for tuberculosis 
Even umara composis 
(Repeat chorus) 
Birds eat it 
And they love it 
Fowls eat it 
Goats love to play with it
