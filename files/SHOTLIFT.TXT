SHOTLIFTER BY MAX
melody pilfered from Mommas & Poppas

A                           G
When I get home from work I feel so bad
C                      E
sick from the wretched day I had
  A                    G     
I sit right down in my favorite chair
    C                         E
and drown all my fears and my dry daymares

A 
Glass of Ice 
G
Bottle of Brown
C                   E
Shotlifting til the sun goes down
F#m                 Bm  
My stomach feels so warm 
G                   E          
suburban angst shotlifting will disarm
F#m          Bm
The TV is a blur
G                        E
Conscience floats away I can't remember

A                  G   
If I came home and had nought to drink
C                               E
News work and girlfriends would feed me too much to think
A                                  G
While I've got the chance I better lift my fill
C                               E 
and if the pain lingers on I'll lift a pill

>Chorus

A                                 G                  
The next day rolls around and the fun fades away
C                            E
draining my soul through the cold work day
A                     G 
Beckoning friend from beyond the grave
  C                       E
I plead someday my sanity you will save

>Chorus
