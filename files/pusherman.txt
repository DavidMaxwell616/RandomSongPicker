you know I've smoked a lot of grass

oh Lord I've popped a lotta pills

but I never took nothing that my spirit could kill

You know I've seen a lot of people walkin round

with tombstones in their eyes

but the pusher don't care if you live or if you die

goddamn the pusher
goddamn the pusher
goddamn the pusher
goddamn the pusherman
