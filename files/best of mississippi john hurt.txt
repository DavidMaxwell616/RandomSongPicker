don't you hear my savious calling 
i said who will go and work today 
yes the fields are ripe and harvest waiting
who will bear the shields away

here am I oh lord send me
here am I oh lord send me
here am I oh lord send me
here am I oh lord send me

If you can't not speak like angels can't preach like paul
yes you can tell the lord is jesus
you can say that he died for us all 

hark the voice of jesus calling
i said who will go and work today 
yes the fields are ripe and harvest waiting
who will bear the shields away

I've got to go to Memphis, bring her back to Leland
I wanna see my baby 'bout a lovin' spoonful, my lovin' spoonful
Well, I'm just got to have my lovin'

(spoken: I found her)

Good mornin', baby, how you do this mornin'?
Well, please, ma'am, just a lovin' spoon,
just a lovin' spoonful
I declare, I got to have my lovin' spoonful

My baby packed her suitcase and she went away
I couldn't let her stay for my lovin',
my lovin' spoonful
Well, I'm just got to have my lovin'

Good mornin', baby, how you do this mornin'?
Well, please, ma'am, just a lovin' spoon,
just a lovin' spoonful
I declare, I got to have my lovin' spoonful

Well, the preacher in the pulpit, jumpin' up and down
He laid his bible down for his lovin'
(spoken: Ain't Maxwell House all right?)

I killed a policeman knocked down the sherrif
it's all about my lovin'

A                      D
That bad man, oh cruel stagolee

He said "Stagolee, Stagolee, please don't take my life
I got two little babies and a darling loving wife."
He's a bad man, oh cruel stagolee

"what do I care about your two little babies and your darling loving wife 
you done stole my stetson hat and I'm bound to take your life
It's a magic hat," oh cruel stagolee

boom boom boom boom went a 44
when I spied Billy Lion he was lying down on the floor
That bad man, oh cruel stagolee

gentlemen of the jury what do you think of that
Stagolee killed Billy Lion for a 5 dollar stetson hat 
He's a bad man, oh cruel stagolee

standing on the gallows Stagolee did curse
judge said "let's kill him before he kills some of us"
He's a bad man, oh cruel stagolee

standing on the gallows his head was way up high
At 12:00 they was all glad to see him die

first verse

Got The Blues Can't Be Satisfied

got the blues can't be satisfied 2X 
if the blues don't kill me gonna catch that train and ride
i got my gal a great big diamond ring 2X 
i took it right back caught her doin' that same old thing
honey what makes you treat your man this way 2X 
cause you know I wants anything you give away
grabbed my shotgun broke that barrel right down 2X  
i put my honey six feet under ground
cut that joker so long deep and wide 2X 
i still got the blues and I can't be satisfied
whiskey straight will drive my blues away 2X 
that bein the case I'll take a quart today

Avalon Blues
 soundclip
 

by Mississippi John Hurt
recording of 19
from The Mississippi John Hurt (Vanguard 19/20), copyright notice

Got to New York this mornin', just about half-past nine
Got to New York this mornin', just about half-past nine
Hollerin' one mornin' in Avalon, couldn't hardly keep from cryin'

Avalon is my hometown, always on my mind
Avalon is my hometown, always on my mind
Pretty mama's in Avalon want me there all the time

When the train left Avalon, throwin' kisses and wavin' at me
When the train left Avalon, throwin' kisses and wavin' at me
Says, "Come back, daddy, and stay right here with me"

Avalon's a small town, have no great big range
Avalon's a small town, have no great big range
Pretty mama's in Avalon, they sure will spend your change

New York's a good town, but it's not for mine
New York's a good town, but it's not for mine
Goin' back to Avalon, near where I have a pretty mama all the time

__________
Note: the occasion for this song was Hurt's 1928 visit to New York for an Okeh Records recording session

 



Casey Jones
 soundclip
 

by Mississippi John Hurt
recording of 19
from Melodeon Records, copyright notice

Casey Jones was a brave engineer,
he told his fireman to not to fear
Says, "All I want, my water and my coal
Look out the window, see my drive wheel roll"

Early one mornin' came a shower of rain,
'round the curve I seen a passenger train
In the cabin was Casey Jones,
he's a noble engineer man but he's dead and gone

"Children, children, get your hat"
Mama, mama, what you mean by that?"
"Get your hat , put it on your head,
go down in town, see if your daddy's dead"

"Mama, mama, how can it be?
My daddy got killed on the old I.C.1"
"Hush your mouth and hold your breath,
you're gonna draw a pension after your daddy's dead"

Casey's wife, she got the news,
she was sittin' on the bedside,
she was lacin' up her shoes
I said, "Go away, children, and hold your breath,
you're gonna draw a pension after your daddy's dead"

Casey said, before he died,
fixed the blinds so the boys can't ride
If they ride, let 'em ride the rod,
trust they lives in the hands of God"

Casey said again, before he died,
one more road that he wanted to ride
People wondered what road could that be?
The Gulf Colorado and the Santa Fe

Casey Jones was a brave engineer,
he told his fireman to not to fear
Says, "All I want, my water and my coal
Look out the window, see my drive wheel roll"

from Worried Blues (Rounder CD-1082), copyright notice

Lonesome is I, wished I could die
Nobody cares for me
Lonesome is I, wished I could die
Nobody cares for me

It was a bright moon lighted night, the moon shining bright,
when you and I made love
Your love wasn't true, I'll say onto you,
I moaned like a turtle dove

Lonesome is I, wished I could die
Nobody cares for me
Lonesome is I, wished I could die
Nobody cares for me

I'm coming home, no more to roam,
darling I'm coming home
I'm coming home, no more to roam,
darling I'm coming home

Lonesome is I, wished I could die
Nobody cares for me
Lonesome is I, wished I could die
Nobody cares for me

It was a bright moon lighted night, the moon shining bright,
when you and I made love
Your love wasn't true, I'll say onto you,

Richland's Woman Blues

by Mississippi John Hurt
recording of 19
from , copyright notice

Gimme red lipstick and a bright purple rouge
A shingle bob haircut1 and a shot of good boo'
Hurry down, sweet daddy, come blowin' your horn
If you come too late, sweet mama will be gone

Come along young man, everything settin' right
My husbands goin' away till next Saturday night
Hurry down, sweet daddy, come blowin' you horn
If you come too late, sweet mama will be gone

Now, I'm raring to go, got red shoes on my feet
My mind is sittin' right for a Tin Lizzie2 seat
Hurry down, sweet daddy, come blowin' you horn
If you come too late, sweet mama will be gone

The red rooster said, "Cockle-doodle-do-do"
The Richard's' woman said, "Any dude will do"
Hurry down, sweet daddy, come blowin' you horn
If you come too late, sweet mama will be gone

With rosy red garters, pink hose on my feet
Turkey red bloomer, with a rumble seat
Hurry down, sweet daddy, come blowin' you horn
If you come too late, sweet mama will be gone

Every Sunday mornin', church people watch me go
My wings sprouted out, and the preacher told me so
Hurry down, sweet daddy, come blowin' you horn
If you come too late, sweet mama will be gone

Dress skirt cut high, then they cut low
Don't think I'm a sport, keep on watchin' me go
Hurry down, sweet daddy, come blowin' you horn
If you come too late, sweet mama will be gone

Police officer, how can it be?
You can 'rest everybody but cruel Stack O' Lee
That bad man, oh, cruel Stack O' Lee

Billy de Lyon told Stack O' Lee, "Please don't take my life,
I got two little babies, and a darlin' lovin' wife"
That bad man, oh, cruel Stack O' Lee

"What I care about you little babies, your darlin' lovin' wife?
You done stole my Stetson1 hat, I'm bound to take your life"
That bad man, cruel Stack O' Lee

...with the forty-four
When I spied Billy de Lyon, he was lyin' down on the floor
That bad man, oh cruel Stack O' Lee

"Gentleman's of the jury, what do you think of that?
Stack O' Lee killed Billy de Lyon about a five-dollar Stetson hat"
That bad man, oh, cruel Stack O' Lee

And all they gathered, hands way up high,
at twelve o'clock they killed him, they's all glad to see him die
