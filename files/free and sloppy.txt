FREE AND SLOPPY
KuerParMax '93

libero e sudicio
 
          D                    G
well I'm free and sloppy I'm drunk and cocky
        D                 A
got an old jalopy for my gal
    D                      G         
my hair is greasy but the money comes easy
         D          A             D  
and now everybody wants to be my pal
(if you want to please me throw in the towel)

      E                           F          
as I lie on the sidewalk and the flies buzz around me
 G                     Em                         A       
people gather talking wondering when I'll settle down

well I'm free and sloppy and you can not stop me
whiskey's already got me satisfied
I'm wild eyed wasted all the good things I've tasted
and my turkey is basted but it's too dry

Chorus

well I'm free and sloppy and you can not stop me
whiskey's already got me satisfied
I'm wild eyed wasted all the good things I've tasted
and my turkey is basted but it's too dry

and my turkey is basted but it's too dry
