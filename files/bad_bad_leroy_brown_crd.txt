Title:               BAD, BAD LEROY BROWN                   (Jim Croce)

                   G
         Well, the south side of Chicago
                A7
         Is the baddest part of town.
                    B7
         And if you go down there
                     C               D7                G
         You better just beware of a man name of Leroy Brown.
         
         Now, Leroy more than trouble,
                    A7
         You see he stand about 'bout six foot four.
                 B7                        C
         All the downtown ladies call him "treetop lover."
                 D7                 G
         All the men just call him "sir."

Chorus:           G
         And he's bad, bad, Leroy Brown,
             A7
         The baddest man in the whole damn town.
         B7              C
         Badder than old King Kong
             D             C
         And meaner than a junkyard dog.

         Now, Leroy, he a gambler,
         and he likes his fancy clothes.
         And he likes to wave diamond rings
         in front of everybody's nose.
         He got a custom Continental.
         He got an Eldorado too.
         He got a thirty-two gun in his pocket for fun.
         He got a razor in his shoe.

         (Chorus)
 
         Well, Friday 'bout a week ago,
         Leroy's shootin' dice.
         And at the edge of the bar sat a girl name of Doris
         and oh, that girl look nice
         Well, he cast his eyes upon her
         and the trouble soon began.
         And Leroy Brown, he learned a lesson 'bout messin'
         with the wife of a jealous man

         (Chorus)
   
               G
         Well, the two men took to fightin'
                       A7
         And when they pulled them from the floor,
         B7                  C                    D7               G
         Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle with a couple of pieces gone.


Out Chorus:            B7                   C
         Yes, you were badder than old King Kong
             D             C        G
         And meaner than a junkyard dog.
