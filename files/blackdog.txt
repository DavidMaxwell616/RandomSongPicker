Hi,

I really dig your guitar tab page, i think it's great.. I only play 
guitar for a short time, like 8 months or so. I'm kind of confused with 
my playing, i'm never satisfied, i seem to go in the direction of 
classic rock and blues-rock. I dig your Cream and Hendrix stuff alot, 
though i was into Page too much lately.

You think you can give me some tips for kind of beginners? i mean the 
tabs are frustrating sometimes..




thanks,


.
