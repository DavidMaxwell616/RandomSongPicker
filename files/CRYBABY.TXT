CRY BABY CRY

G        Am   F                G
Cry baby cry, make your mother sigh
      Em                 A7       F        
She's old enough to know better

    Em       Emd7               Em7                Em6            C7
The King of Marigold was in the kitchen cooking breakfast for the queen
    Em               Emd7            Em7           Em6            C7
The queen was in the parlor playing piano for the children of the king

G        Am   F                G
Cry baby cry, make your mother sigh
      Em                 A7              
She's old enough to know better
   F        G
So cry baby cry

The King was in the garden picking flowers for a friend who came to play
The queen was in the playroom painting pictures for the childrens holiday

(chorus)

The Duchess of Kircaldy always smiling and arriving late for tea
The duke was having problems with a message at the local Bird and Bee

(chorus)

At twelve o'clock a meeting round the table for a seance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere put on specially by the children for a lark
