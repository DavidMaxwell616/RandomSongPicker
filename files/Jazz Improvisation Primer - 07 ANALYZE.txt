Marc Sabatella's Jazz Improvisation Primer: Listening Analytically

Now that you have some idea of what it takes to play jazz, you should have
a much more critical ear.  You will be less likely to be impressed with
mere technical facility, and can listen for melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic
sophistication.  On the other hand, if the music still reaches you
emotionally, do not worry that it does not seem particularly adventurous
when scrutinized closely.  Do not let your analysis of the theoretical
aspects of music interfere with your reaction on an emotional level.  The
theoretical knowledge should be a tool to help you understand music you
might not have otherwise appreciated; it should not detract from your
enjoyment of any music.

As a performer, now that you have some idea of the things a jazz musician
is expected to do, you can listen to the great ones and learn from them.
You can listen to the early Bill Evans trios and see examples of interplay
within a rhythm section, and try to develop ears as big as theirs.  You can
listen to Thelonious Monk and analyze the way he used dissonance and
syncopation, and see if you can achieve the same effects.  You can listen
to the emotional outbursts of John Coltrane or Cecil Taylor and expand your
concept of how directly you can express yourself.
