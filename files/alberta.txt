G      Bm        F     D    G    
Alberta let your hair hang low
  G                    D    G
I saw her first on an April morn
       G                  Bm         C       D
as she walked through the mist in a field of hay
        G                            C      G
And her hair lit the world with its golden glow
        G            Bm   F          D    G    
and the smile on her face burned my heart away
G      Bm        F     D    G
Alberta let your hair hang low
G                F         D
Alberta let your hair hang low

     C             Bm             D         G
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
          G   Bm         F    D    G 
If you'll only let your hair hang low

  G                  D           G
I thought my golden dream would last
         G       Bm      C        D
but the field of hay was soon cut down
      G                   C        G
in a short few weeks our time had passed
         G          Bm     F      D       G
and the girl of my dreams just a painful song

G      Bm      F   D    G
Alberta what's on your mind?
G              F        D
Alberta what's on your mind?

   C           Bm            D           G
My heart is so sad cause you treat me so bad
  G    Bm        F    D     G
Alberta let your hair hang low
