Gonna take a fifth of Old Weller just to set me free

(Feelin's gettin' low now just about over my head)2X
Thank you Lord, I can drown in bourbon instead
(107 bourbon gonna clear my mind)2X
Gonna ease my head just like smokin' the kind

Hear me pound it now
You can hear my Old Weller howl
And if I drink too much brown
You're gonna see me go down

(Thing about whiskey blues, papa don't feel no pain)2X
It's the only kind of blues i'd sure like to feel again
(Gimme 107 bourbon  baby til I die)2X
If it comes sooner than later I'll sure know why

AIMLESS BUT SHAMELESS 

G
Well I'm a little slice of confusion, and my mind floats aimlessly. 
Unemployed, out of touch with Freud as I tailspin eternally. 
A#
As I plummet to the earth I got a dram on my hip.
G
It will take a sea of whiskey to save my sinking ship.

  F          D/F#                G
  Sinking or Rising, soon you'll see, 
  you won't find no lies inside of me
  You think you're rising, but soon you'll see 
  you can't keep blaming your lies on me
  Now  Satan's rising inside me and 
  soon you'll have some worms to feed

Some folks call me hopeless cause I got no sweltering pride
Pathos drowning Hubris, will be my alibi. Bands in town can
run around waiting to find or to be found while the wind
it whistles through their ears, makin' an eerie sound.

Chorus

Blind drunk in the dark I stagger, I don't need my eyes
to see My heart is true but my eyes deceive divert my soul
from whiskey. I don't need no cocaine, wheelchair or a crutch.
I'll just take your bottle, please, and thank you very much.

BEER WASTING WOMAN

C                            D7      F       G             C
We could have lasted another year if you'd a finished your beer. 
Shouldn't a smashed it on my head. I would have drank the beer instead.

  Am                 E7    Am                   D
  Broken glass in my face, but wasting beer's a disgrace
  Am          G              C                 E
  I should've killed you for committing such a crime

I could have taken the pain some more, 
now I'd rather spill you on the floor. 
I took all I could possibly use, 
and got much more pleasure out of booze

chorus

Now that you're out of the bar,
I know I don't have to look far. 
Bottles and friends are very near and 
plenty of girls that finish their beer

DRUNK AND FAMOUS - words by erich

    G            C                E          G        C         E
My once tender, fleecy shades of green have turned a temporary blue. 
Soon, I fear, to turn the hazy shades for now the blues give way to soon
Bm         F          D     Bm             F         A     
For now, I tremble in rage. My fingers are cigarette stained.
Em       G                   D           
Growing must be fought, the message it screams. 
Dm                      Dm/F      A7
I've stepped out of the green too soon. 
Em             G    D           
In throwing myself upon the flame, 
  Dm          Dm/F    A7           D      D9/C
I insure not only my doom but my fame.

Once you're ahead, where can you go? 
Fame has won me countless friends, yet I sit here, 
all alone. My eyes watch the leaves out  in the street.
Autumn has descended like a dream, the greens of 
summer are now obscene Now my life is burning away,
too drunk to fear dying, the awful void looks okay.
For the rest who follow, the void will not look the same.
In the all engulfing black there will be a single,
receding flame. 

The light is fading from the sky,
every night is longer than the last. 
Soon it will be my time to die but first let us 
have another glass. When winter comes and fall fades, 
as it always does and we will always rage. Like leaves 
that fall from a dying drying tree, 
Ashes from a cigarette on your floor. 
We'll softly drop down into a jug of whiskey, 
for my love and summer are no more

Tried to get a lady got a gator instead
You should've seen that lizard rockin' my bed
I would've got another but I didn't have the bread

We were so good together, a better team you couldn't find

Now that  it's all over, I'm  free to do as I please
Pounding whiskey women darvon novril helps me keep my mind at ease 
This ending's caught me by surprise, and now it's time to close my eyes

KILLING IS THE ONLY HONESTY

B7             C7 B7  E7     B7                C7     B7       E7
Killing is the only honesty, better than false smiles of razor edged teeth. 
    G#                      B

than to buy me a drink, shake my hand as he takes off with my wife.

My life is tortured by forgotten memories, Drunks Against Vodka In Domine, 
that spells DAVID for me every day. 
Mediocre can't get enough while the finest roll on by satisfied 

Pathetic or prophetic I'm blue as I watch the ego world of smarm collapse around you.
Killing is the only life for me 
braincells are targets and I'm  out on a spree. They're all ready to die.

My lungs are roastin' ready and born to ripe The bottle's already started as I load up my pipe
This song flows like the blood from R. Bud Dwyer's nose
Optical nerve dies as the mind it grows

I walk through the streets in obscurity. I don't bother nobody and they don't bother me.
I keep to myself and I live alone. 
Life ain't worth living if you're living for somebody else 
and you ain't livin' your own.

D   C                 A          F  G  
I'm just enjoying the atmosphere        
while my head fights against becoming clear. 
Grownups raised through childhood fear. 
Their worries poured through great big steins of beer. 
Questions as vague as daughters of Lear. 
Signs of hope very far from near.

D               F           C     C#dim
To them life is deprecating and devoid,
the torture it turns as a man turns into boy
We all are drowning in our seas of obey 
we lose more opportunity every single day

Glasses are emptied and our dreams realized
Some draw their swords way too quick and then  surmise
That the unfelt passions behind our eyes
Make the lewd unlucky ones deify
All our visions are poor and bleak 
just to scan one horizon takes too many weeks. 

D                F            C           C#dim          
Our strength is gone and the weakness it reigns 
as obligatory minds drive us into the sane. 
We all are drowning in our seas of obey 
we lose more opportunity every single day

       F          G              D 
The unconscious clings to mundanity. 
 F         G         D  
True realization is LSD
True realization is LSD
True realization is LSD

outro:
D        C    A          F        G
Blood is everywhere, (it's in de streets)
kind blood is everywhere (it's in your eyes)
etc.

NOTHING

F#                                 
I met a girl, she was half my height, she said 
C7                             
"You're gonna be mine tonight, 
F#
but it's only fair if I tell you right now, 
C7
you make no difference anyhow.
F#                  E   A7                      D7
You mean nothing to me, I mean I see you like a dog sees a flea."

So she took me right home and she sat me down and said,
"I'm gonna turn your world around."
I said "Lady what're you tryin' to prove, 
you can't tame my stone groove.
Don't call me nothing again. You don't got what it takes to win."

Just then I noticed my wallet was missin' and I screamed,
"Lady you better listen..I got five knuckles, gonna lay you still, 
then we'll see who's nothing, yes we will."

And then a man entered and he was so big 
he made Iron Mike Tyson look like a twig. 
So I swallowed my pride and away I run. 
Away I run to get my shotgun.
And she'll be nothing no more, and I'll be headed
for the liquor store.
Nothing no more, and I'll be headed for the liquor store

SHOTFACED

Em      
As I sit here, I wonder why, I'm still on the ground and I cannot fly 
Am
Watch me fumble, like so many times before.
G                C                  Em     
Watch me stumble and wind up on the floor. 
D                      A                Em
I'm just too shotfaced everyday it gets worse. 
B7                                              Em
Tried to find my love, but the whiskey found me first.

People around here feign sympathy the same.
Feets don't fail me now, I got to get away.
Everybody is so incomplete. 
Change your position, you will lose your seat. 
Just too shotfaced, if you don't mind, I'm satisfied. 
I might have tortured you, but at least I never lied

  Em                              
  All numbers add up to the same, 
  Am 
  Emotions never play that game
  Em                                         B7 
  I don't know what should matter most but I say
  Em
  sobers don't play straight games anyway

Pathetic, esoteric and lonely it's true but still I slide
uphill and look sadly down at you. Please don't ask me why.
If I knew when I answered, I'd have looked you 
dead in the eye. We're all alone, all alone in our minds.
I tried to find my love, but the whiskey met the kind.

Standing in the hallway of some stranger's house.
E                     F#sus             G          D
The party had started raging when the liquor ran out.
E              F#sus         G            C 
I looked at my buddy and I patted on my chest,

E              F#sus            G                           D 
Music couldn't hold the pace, and the liquor store's past closing hour.

  Am   F             G      Am     F        G                     
  As I busted out my flask, radars honed in attention stirred fast. 
  F#                        Bm          
  Zombies circled 'round my buzz was their prey.
      A                            B7  
  The seagulls had descended and I could not get away.

For a fleeting moment sweet heaven was mine, all mine,
the liquid ceased all thoughts as whiskey caressed my mind.
My pal and I danced around, funky rhythms drove us on.
Indiscretion on my part and our cover was blown.
Fugitive pied pipers of parasitic boozehounds.
"Please just one shot, Max, tomorrow I'm getting an ounce"

Chorus

Making temporary friends we were a Godsend to those folks
now friendlier, their stomachs warm, the girls lit up 
their smokes.  Buzzes around us began to drain the lives
of ours. My flask went bone dry, they all left within half
an hour. Soon  we headed home, my friend's spirits were glum,
until I reminded him of the gallon at home that the flask
had come from. 

So when you all go out to rage, think for
yourself and act your age. Drinking for the moment will
leave you dry at the end of the night, and the seagulls
will descend and you cannot put up a fight.

SHOTLIFTER

A                             G   
When I get home from work and feel so bad
C                      E7
sick from the wretched day I had
  A                    G
I sit right down in my favorite chair
    C                         E7
and drown all my fears and my dry daymares

  A                    G
  with a glass of ice, bottle of brown
  C                   E
  shotlifting til the sun goes down
  F#m                 Bm    G                      E
  my stomach feels so warm, white collar angst shotlifting will disarm
  F#m     Bm    G                        E           
  TV is a blur, conscience floats away I can't remember

If I got home from work and I had nought to drink
The news, rent and my girlfriend will give me
too much to think
so I sit right down and drink my fill
and if the pain lingers on I'll have a pill

Chorus

Next day rolls around, the fun fades away
drains from my raging in the cold work day
beckoning friend from beyond the grave
I plead someday my sanity that you will save

Chorus

WHAT A WONDERFUL BUZZ

      F       Am         Bb       Am
I see buds of green with hairs of red 
Gm7           F    A7       Dm         Db     
they feel so good inside my head and I think to myself 
 C9     C7        F       
"What a wonderful buzz"

I drink lakes of beer oceans of booze, my liver and kidneys
 are mine to lose as I think to myself 
"What a wonderful buzz"

    C7                  F   
The color of whiskey so pretty on the shelf
     C7                   F 
just waiting to flow deep inside of myself.
      Dm         C/E          Dm/F         C/G       
I see funnels go down through thousands of throats.
     Dm/F                 F#dim
They laugh, fall down and puke on themselves 
    Gm7      F#dim  C7
and that's all she wrote

I hear braincells scream, "Please Max, no more!"
I laugh as I drown them, and pass out on the floor
and I think to myself, "What a wonderful buzz" 

Am7-5    D7

      Gm7              C7-9             F
