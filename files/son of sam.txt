SON OF SAM - ELLIOTT SMITH

Am C#m7 Am D Fm G D/F# F E
  
Something's happening, don't speak too soon
I told the boss off, made my move, got nowhere to go
son of sam, son of the shining path, the clouded mind
the couple killer each and every time
I'm not uncomfortable feeling weird
lonely, leered, options disappeared, but I know what to do
son of sam, son of a doctor's touch, a nurse's love
acting under orders from above
king for a day
son of sam, son of the shining path, the clouded mind
the couple killer running out of time
shiva opens her arms now
to make sure I don't get too far
I may talk in my sleep tonight cause I don't know what I am
I'm a little like you
more like son of sam
