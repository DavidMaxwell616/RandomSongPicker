Fastball: The Way

capo up 3rd fret

      Am                                   Dm
They made up their minds and they started packing
      E                               Am
They left before the sun came up that day
    A7                     Dm
An exit to eternal summer slacking
     Am                      E                     Am
But where were they going without ever knowing the way? 

They drank up the wine and they got to talking
They now had more important things to say
And when the car broke down they started walking
But where were they going without ever knowing the way? 

G

Chorus:
                      C                         G
Anyone could see the road that they walk on is paved in gold
     Am                          E 
And it's always summer, they'll never get cold
         F                         C                 G  
They'll never get hungry. They'll never get old and gray.

You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere
They won't get make it home, but they really don't care
      F                          C             G      E
They wanted the highway. They're happy there today, today  

The children woke up and they couldn't find them
They left before the sun came up that day
They just drove off and left it all behind them
But where were they going without ever knowing the way?
