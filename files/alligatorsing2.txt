JOE BALL TRILOGY, PART 1

Joe Ball as I recall, thought he had the answer to it all y'all
he had a falling out without a doubt that eventually led him wayward
when in the mood, he'd turn his waitresses into alligator food
Payin' no mind to the everynosy neighbors

one dusty day I heard the tavernkeeper say
it's takes a good long time to figure out the one you're with
I looked around and saw the devil babies roaming round
As she paid the bill I took my last breath

the stench of disbelief stifled my diplomacy
uncle testy lights the way for death
go pubic
Kicking back and listening to the alligator sing
and that ring on your finger is stolen baby
