intro:     a   (4x)

a
friday night i crashed your party,    

saturday i said i'm sorry
                                                         e 
sunday came and trashed me out again.
           bm 
i was only having fun,   
                g
wasn't hurting anyone
             e   
and we all enjoyed the 
                           a        intro (2x)
weekend for a change.

                        
i've been stranded 
in the combat zone, 
i walked through bedford sty alone
even rode my motorcycle in the rain.
and you told me not to drive,   
but i made it home alive
so you said that only proves that i'm insane.

chorus:
                      e 
you may be right,   
                  a
i may be crazy
            e                     d
but it just may be a lunatic 
               f#m         a 
you're looking for
                     e
turn out the light,
                     a
don't try to save me
                         d                  e                               
you may be wrong for all i know, 
                            a      intro (4x)
but you may be right. 

                                
remember how i found you there, 
alone in your electric chair
i told you dirty jokes until you smiled.
you were lonely for a man,   
i said take me as i am
cause you might enjoy 
some madness for a while.


now think of all the years you tried 
to find some one to satisfy you
i might be as crazy as you say.
if i'm crazy then it's true,   
that it's all because of you
and you wouldn't want me any other way.


chorus
 

lead break  (same chords as verse)    
a              e        bm      g      e       a


chorus

outro
      a                        
you may be wrong, but you may be right


it's a good rocky song so have fun with it.

enjoy
Stuart
