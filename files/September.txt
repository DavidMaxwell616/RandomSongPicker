      Do you remember the 21st night of September?
      Love was changing the mind of pretenders
      While chasing the clouds away

      Our hearts were ringing
      In the key that our souls were singing.
      As we danced in the night,
      Remember - how the stars stole the night away, yeah yeah yeah.

      Hey hey hey,
      Ba de ya - say do you remember
      Ba de ya - dancing in September
      Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

      Ba duda, ba duda, ba duda, badu
      Ba duda, badu, ba duda, badu
      Ba duda, badu, ba duda

      My thoughts are with you
      Holding hands with your heart to see you
      Only blue talk and love,
      Remember - how we knew love was here to stay

      Now December found the love that we shared in September.
      Only blue talk and love,
      Remember - the true love we share today


      Hey hey hey
      Ba de ya - say do you remember
      Ba de ya - dancing in September
      Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day.......there was a
      Ba de ya - say do you remember

      Now our bell was ringing, aha
      Our souls were singing.
      Do you remember every cloudy day - yau !

      There was a
      Ba de ya - say do you remember
