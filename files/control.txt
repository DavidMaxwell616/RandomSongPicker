Puddle of Mud - Control

D F C G7

I love the way you look at me
I feel the pain you place inside
Lock me up inside your dirty cage 
well I'm alone inside my mind

I'd like to teach you all the rules
I get to see them set in stone
I like it when you chain me to the bed
but then your secrets never shown

Chorus
I need to feel you
You need to feel me
I can't control you
You're not the one for me no
I can't control you
You can't control me
I need to feel you
So why is it even...

I love the way you break my skin
I feel the hate you place inside
I need to get your voice out of my head
'cause I'm the guy you'll never find
You think you know all of the rules
There's no expression on your face
I hope that someday you will let me go
Release me from my dirty cage

Chorus
you and me

I love the way you look at me
I love the way you smack my ass
I love the dirty things you do
I have control of you

Chorus
