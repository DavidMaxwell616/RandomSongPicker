Bassists got the easy life.

Only got four strings to tune.

Busted for evidence I can't even smoke

free Brenda Wiley the sweet Raccoon.

Goddamn I'm furniture once again. 
Voluntary paralysis is my best friend. 
Did you know Erich was dosing all day long. 
Max didn't know. He's not even quite sure now.

Hey you Mortachriste, Manhattan's not for the living it's for the drinking.

Grieve for Pigpen, not Brent Mydland. 

I don't care for no pseudophistication. 
Stuck in the rut of the pallid civilization. 
I'm happy living in this 90 proof percent. 
conspicuous consumption is probably my only asset.

Empty headed oblivion stands at the main gate.
If Grover boils over just throw him on my plate.
Tight hamstrings sauteed over fava beans. 
Chewing up the scenery, regurgitating spleens.

This is where an iron block of text once stood.
Projections when reflected are not meant to be
understood.
Now the page is empty full of yesterday's news.

Find the wahwah within yourself 
 A                   E 
and loosen all the screws
