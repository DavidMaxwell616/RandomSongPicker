SOULSUCKER

scabby vermin with festering sores
scurry across my hardwood floors
nourished by pain and envious of others
you gnaw on shortcomings and torment your brothers

the peaks are pricey and valleys are dicey
underendowed in every way
telling employees you want it yesterday
hammering jokes like Hephaestus on speed
obviousness reigns your hypocratic creed

you pounce on the wounded and drive them insane
but when boomeranged, suddenly you're not to blame
you better pray that she doesn't catch you in your lies
and goes back to the rockies with lust in her eyes

maybe that will drive the rapacious thirst from your heart
maybe next time you won't push her too far
maybe you could have been nicer to know
maybe if once your parents had said "no"
