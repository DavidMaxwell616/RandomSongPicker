EVERYBODY'S TALKING

(F Fmaj7)4x

F   Fmaj7    F      Fmaj7
Everybody's talking at me
F7   F6         F7   F6
I don't hear a word they're saying
A#sus    A#    A#9 A#    D#
only the echoes of my mind
people stop and stare
I can't see their faces
only the shadows of their eyes

G#5                   A#
I'm going where the sun keeps shining
D#                    D#7
through the pouring rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes
Banking off of the northeast winds
sailing on summer breeze
skipping over the ocean like a storm

whoaa...

(repeat chorus)

Everybody's talking at me
Don't care about a word they're saying
only the echoes of my mind
I won't let you leave my love behind
I won't let you leave...
