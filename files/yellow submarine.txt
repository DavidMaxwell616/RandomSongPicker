title:Yellow Submarine
st:John Lennon/Paul McCartney

        D         C     G 
In the town where I was born
Em      Am                 D 
Lived a man who sailed the sea.
G        D      C       G
And he told us of his life
Em     Am           D
In the land of submarines.

So we sailed up to the sun
'Till we found the sea of green,
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine.

     G                D
     We all live in a yellow submarine,
                       G
     Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
     G                D
     We all live in a yellow submarine,
                       G
     Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.

And our friends are all aboard,
Many more of them live next door,
And the band begins to play.

     We all live in a yellow submarine,
     Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
     We all live in a yellow submarine,
     Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.

As we live a life of ease,
Everyone of us has all we need.
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our yellow submarine.

     We all live in a yellow submarine,
     Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
     We all live in a yellow submarine,
     Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
