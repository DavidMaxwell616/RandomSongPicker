Intro: D5

G
Well you think you had a good time
          E                Eb E
With the boy that you just met
Gm
Kicking sand from beach to beach
          D
Your clothes all soaking wet
G
But if you look around and see
    E7
A shadow on the run
Gm                              D
Don't be too surprised if its just a paper sun

Cm7  Bb G  A   Cm7 Bb G   A
Ahh Paper Sun, Ahh Paper Sun

In the room where you've been sleeping
All your clothes all thrown about
Cigarettes burn window sills 
Your meter's all run out
But then again its nothing
You just split when day is done
Pitching lips to nowhere, hung up on the paper sun

(no chord)
Standing in the cool of my room
Fresh cut flowers give me sweet perfume
D         F   G    D 
Too much sun will burn!

When you're feeling tired and lonely
You see people going home
You can't make the train fare
Or the six pence for the phone
And icicles your crying 
>From your cheek have just begun
Dont be sad, good times are had
Beneath the paper sun

Daily breaks while you sleep on the sand
The cigarettes peeling the ring from your hand
The boy who had given you so much fun
Has left you so cold in the paper sun
