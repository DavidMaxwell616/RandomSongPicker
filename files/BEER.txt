We could have lasted another year if you'd a finished your beer. 
Shouldn't a smashed it on my head. I would have drank the beer instead.

  Am                 E7    Am                   D
  Broken glass in my face, but wasting beer's a disgrace
  Am          G               F                E
  They oughta lock you up for committing such a crime

I could have taken the pain some more, 
and happily pass out on the floor. 
I took all I could possibly use, 
and got much more pleasure out of booze

chorus

Now that you're out of the bar,
I know I don't have to look far. 
Bottles and friends are very near and 
plenty of girls that finish their beer
