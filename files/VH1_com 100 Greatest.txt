            100 Greatest Albums of Rock 'N' Roll

            You stared at the cover art, pored over the liner notes, and spun 
            the discs so many times they had to be replaced. They're albums you 
            never get sick of, and the last 50 years of music have produced 
            plenty of 'em. Only 100 essentials make the final cut of VH1's 100 
            Greatest Albums of Rock 'N' Roll, a five-night special featuring 
            archival clips and new exclusive interviews. See which works were 
            selected by our expert pack of musicians and rock journalists (we 
            promise a Beatles album or five). Join host Jeff Bridges and see how 
            your collection stacks up!
