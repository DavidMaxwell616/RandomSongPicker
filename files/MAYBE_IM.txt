		Bb        F                     C               G
		Maybe I'm amazed at the way you love me all the time
		Bb        F                   C        Erun
		Maybe I'm afraid of the way I love you
		Bb        F                       C                G
		Maybe I'm amazed athe the way you pulled me out of time
		    Bb           F
		And hung me on a line
		Ab        G                          C
		Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you


		D           Dmaj7                 Ddim7
	CHORUS:	Maybe I'm a man and maybe I'm a lonely man 
	   |	
	   |	Who's in the middle of something
	   |	G                                 Dm7
	   |	That he dosen't really understand
	   |	D           Dmaj7                      Ddim7
	   |	Maybe I'm a man and maybe you're the only woman
	   |	
	   |	Who could ever help me
	   |	G                                Dm7
	   |	Baby won't you help me understand
