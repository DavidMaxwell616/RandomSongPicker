Transcribed by: Clay Duggan


Intro:

G   Em   A7   D        x2


       G                             B7
That's life (that's life), that's what all the people say
Em                          A7
You're ridin' high in April, shot down in May
G                    B7           Em
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
      A7                              D
When I'm back on top, back on top in June


               G                      B7
I said that's life (that's life), and as funny as it may seem
Em                          A7
Some people get their kicks stompin' on a dream
    G                   B7         Em
But I don't let it, let it get me down
             A7             D                 G     C  G
'cause this fine old world, it keeps spinnin' around


G                                                 G7
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
           C                           C7
I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing
A7
Each time I find myself flat on my face
D              D          D    D      D
I pick myself up and get back in the race


       G                              B7
That's life (that's life), I tell you I can't deny it
Em                           A7
I thought of quitting, baby, but my heart just ain't gonna buy it
G                        B7                  Em
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try
A7                          D              G   C  G
I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly

G                                                 G7
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
           C                           C7
I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing
A7
Each time I find myself laying flat on my face
D              D          D#
I pick myself up and get back in the race

G#                                          C7
That's life (that's life), that's life and I can't deny it
Fm                                  A#7
Many times I thought of cuttin' out but my heart won't buy it
G#                    C7                      Fm
But if there's nothin' shakin' come this here July
          A#7                  D#            G#   B7  E  D#
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball a-and die

D#  G#
My, my!
