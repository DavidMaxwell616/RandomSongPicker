SHINE ON HARVEST MOON

     Am                       
The night was mighty dark so you could hardly see.
                          E7
For the moon refused to shine.
 Am
There's a couple sitting 'neath a willow tree,
     E7
For love they pine.
F                                       C
Little maid was kind afraid of darkness so she said,
"I think I'll go."
D7
Boy began to sigh,
Looked up at the sky,
                                  G  E7 
Told the moon his little tale of woe.

     A7                          D7                               
Oh, Shine on, shine on harvest moon, up in the sky,
G                             C                            
I ain't had no lovin' since January February, June or July,
 A7                         D7
Snow time ain't no time to stay outdoors and spoon,
     G                         C         G         C
So shine on, shine on harvest moon, for me and my gal.

Am
I can't see why a boy should sigh where by his side
                         E7
Is the girl he loves so true
Am
All he has to say is, "Won't you be my bride
    E7
For I love you.
F
Why should I be telling you this secret
C
When I know that you can guess?
D7
Harvest moon will smile
Shine on all the while
                                   G          E7 
If the little girl should answer,"Yes."
