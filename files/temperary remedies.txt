TEMPERARY REMEDIES
11.29.03

Verse 1:

A
I wish I had a gun so I could stare down the barrel of it
Em
I wish I wasn't drunk so I could Get that way.
C
I wish there was a hole so I could make out a plug for it
                       A 
And not have to drive myself to Therapy.


A rabbit's foot
Some cloud cover
A bottle and a lazy lover
Who aint gonna push for intimacy

CHORUS 1:
These are the things.
These are the feelings.
Homer Simpson and Klonopin & Wild Turkey
Make things soft and warm and dry
Baby wish they'd tell me why
These are only temporary remedies.

Temporary Remedies
Give them to Me!

VERSE 2:

I wish I had a God so I could bow on down to it
Wish I didn't hate the world for all it did to me
I wish there was a high that let me stay right inside of it
Wish I had a bomb to blow up everything

Fuck George Bush 
And all that jazz
I'll protest with a flower vase
My bong raised high in solidarity

CHORUS 2:
These are the things.
These are the feelings.
Pornography and Comic books and X-Box Three
Make things soft and warm and dry
Baby wish they'd tell me why
These are only temporary remedies.

Temporary Remedies
Give them to Me!

VERSE 3:
I wish I had a mom so I could suck on the breast of it
I wish I had a knife so I could kill my dad
I wish I had a way to say I really hate this bullshit
And not have to learn my poppa's language

Fuck your lousy world, son
It's hard to walk
So I wont run
Fuck you fucker fucker fuck you!

CHORUS 3:
These are the things.
These are the feelings.
Teletubbies, Pokemon and sugar sweets
Make things soft and warm and dry
Baby wish they'd tell me why
These are only temporary remedies.

Temporary Remedies
Give them to Me!
