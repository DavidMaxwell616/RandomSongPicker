High Flying Bird - Richie Havens version

Am                         Dm                    Am
There's a high flying bird flying way up in the sky
       C             E                 Am
and I wonder if she looks down as she goes on by
            Am        G                   E7         
well she's flying so free and easy in the sky

Chorus-
              Am  Dm                    Am
Lord, look at me     I'm rooted like a tree
         C        G
Got the sit down can't cry
F             E         Am
Oh Lord, I'm gonna die blues

Now the sun it comes up and lights up the day
and when he gets tired Lord he goes down on his way
To the east and the west he meets god every day

Now I had a woman Lord she lived down by the mine
She ain't never never seen the sun or stopped crying
then one day my woman up and died
She up and died Lord she up and died
and the only way to fly is to die

Repeat first verse & chorus
