Subject: CRD/LYR: Hand In My Pocket - Alanis Morissette
Date: Wed, 26 Jul 95 15:46:00 pst


I know this song is pretty basic, musically, but I figured it would be
timely and work well in my solo acoustic sets around the San Jose-area
coffeehouses.  Since I went to the trouble of transcribing all the lyrics,
I can't see a reason not to share it here!

I believe Alanis sings this in the key of D; to accomodate my male singing
voice, I have transposed it down to Bb (or B, depending on capo placement).
I use 'open-A' fingering, with the capo on the first or second fret.  I've
shown the music below as just being in 'A', however.  (Put your capo on
the 5th fret to play along with the record, or transpose this back to the
open-D position without a capo).

As the music is basically a 'drone' type of sound, I use variations of the
basic open-A chord position to lend some variance to my solo accompaniment,
namely, the -sus2 and -sus4 forms of the basic A-chord, as follows:

   A  Asus2  Asus4

e--0----0------0-------
B--2----0------3-------
G--2----2------2-------
D--2----2------2-------
A--0----0------0-------
E--x----x------x-------

The chord variations below are only suggestions;
mix 'em up as you see fit!

Here's the song:


                  Hand In My Pocket          --  Alanis Morissette



     A            Asus2      Asus4        Asus2
I'm broke but I'm happy, I'm sore but I'm kind
     A             Asus2    A
I'm short but I'm healthy, yeah
     A            Asus2      Asus4        Asus2
I'm high but I'm grounded, I'm sane but I'm overwhelmed
     A           Asus2     A
I'm lost but I'm hopeful, baby


    Asus2              G6      D
And what it all comes down to
                              Asus2        A
Is that everything's gonna be fine, fine, fine
            G6
Cause I got one hand in my pocket
         D                          A
And the other one is givin' a high five


I feel drunk but I'm sober, I'm young and I'm underpaid
I'm dyin' but I'm workin', yeah
I care but I'm restless, I'm here but I'm really gone
I'm wrong and I'm sorry, baby

And what it all comes down to
Is that ev'rything's gonna be quite alright
Cause I got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is flickin' a cigarette

(instr.)

And what it all comes down to
Is that I haven't got it all figured out just yet
Cause I got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is givin' a peace sign


I'm free but I'm focused, I'm green but I'm wise
I'm hard but I'm friendly, baby
I'm sad but I'm laughin', I'm brave but I'm chickenshit
I'm sick but I'm pretty, baby

And what it all boils down to
Is that no one's really got it figured out just yet
Well I got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is playin' a piano

And what it all comes down to, my friend, yeah
Is that everything is just fine, fine, fine
Cause I got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is hailing a taxi cab




Enjoy!
