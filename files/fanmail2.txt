Hey Maxx.  I had left this note in the submission box but I thought it more likely you'd see it here so I pasted to email.  I read some of those submissions (comments by the peanut gallery) - some folks can be morons.  I did however like a couple of the requests, Stranglehold and there was a request for Leonard Cohen.  I am working on Bird on a Wire if you want it I'll send it when finished.
                                                                   Charlie  

Hello Maxx,
              I just wanted to say hello and thank you for your web page.  It is well done and the tabs are clear and easy to read.  I haven't tried them yet but clearity is usually a good sign. I am just learning and Hendrix is sort of my focus, it was nice to see that you had done so much. (and I just looked up at my screne and saw that you have some Santana as well -I'll come back to visit.  By the way I have never done a TAB but I have transcribed a fiew songs: may be I could write some down as Tabs sometime soon. Do you take submissions?  I'll stop in and visit again soon.

                      Thanks again,

                               Charlie
