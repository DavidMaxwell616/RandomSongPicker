Creedence Clearwater Revival Lyrics: Run Through The Jungle 

Whoa, thought it was a nightmare,
Lord, it's all so true,
They told me, "Don't go walking slow
'Cause Devil's on the loose."

CHORUS:
Better run through the jungle,
Better run through the jungle,
Better run through the jungle,
Woa, Don't look back to see.

Thought I heard a rumbling
Calling to my name,
Two hundred million guns are loaded
Satan cries, "Take aim!"

CHORUS

Over on the mountain
Thunder magic spoke,
"Let the people know my wisdom,
Fill the land with smoke."

CHORUS
