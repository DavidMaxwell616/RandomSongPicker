Fancy Pants - by Ween
 
here's a basic version of Fancy Pants,
play along to the song to get the rhythym correct


intro (D > E > D > C > B > A > G)

verse:

G (slide down to Gflat every 4 beats)

A > D (slide down to Dflat every 4 beats)

then to (D > C > B > A > G )


middle eight (??)

E > A > G (?)
E > A > A7

then to the little rundown again (D > C > B > A > G )


ending:

G > D > G
