Seasons in the sun

F
Good bye to you my thrusted friend, we`ve known each other since we were
Gm
nine or ten; together we climbed hills and trees,
F                          Gm                  C7
learned of love A B C; skinned our harts and skinned our
 F                                                                                              Gm
knees. Good bye my friend it`s hard to die, when all the birds are singing in the sky
                                 C7     F
now that the spring is in the air
                               Gm      C7                             F
pretty girls are ev'`ry where, think of me and I`ll be there

                                                Gm
We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun,
            C7                                                            F  Eb E
but the hills thet we climb were just seasons out of time.


Goodbye papa plees pray for me, I was the blacksheep of the family,'
you tried to teach me right from wrong, too much wine and too much song,
wounder how I got along.
Goodbye papa it`s hard to die, when all the birds are singing in the sky,
now that the spring is in the air,
little children everywere ,
when you see them I'll be there.

We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun,
but the wine and the song like the seasons out of time.

Goodbye Michelle my little one,
you gave me love and helped me find the sun,
and every time that  I was down,
you always come around and
get my feet back on the ground,
Goodbye Michelle it's hard to die,
when all the birds are singing in the sky,
now that the spring is in the air,
whit the flowers everywhere,
I wish that we could both be there.

We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun
but the stars we could reach were just starfish on the beach
"Every thing was better in the good old days,
 when everybody was in pain"

         how it all goes together.....

   (note: in the song, theres no guitar during the first
    half of each verse, just a cheesy keyboard figure. I've
    listed guitar chords anyway; I usually play them with
    a palm mute to simulate the keyboard)
