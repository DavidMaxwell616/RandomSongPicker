E                                          
Please don't dominate the rap Jack, if you got nothin' new to say.
    E                                              
And if you please, don't back up the tracks, this train's got to run today.

 E
I spent a little time on the mountain, spent a little time on the hill.

E                                 G             D            A
Like some say, better run away; others say you better stand still.

    E                                      G       D             A
Now I don't know but I been told that it's hard to run with the weight of gold  
       E                                    G       D             A
On the other hand, I've heard it said, it's just as hard with the weight of lead
									

E                                
Who can deny, who can deny, it's not just a change of style.
E                                      
One step done and another begun, and I wonder how many miles.
  E
I spent a little time on the mountain, spent a little time on the hill,
E                                       G         D       A
Things went down we don't understand but I think in time we will.
      E                                       G           D         A
Now, I don't know, but I've been told in the heat of the sun a man died of cold. 
E                                         G       D            A
Keep on comin' or stand and wait with the sun so dark and the hour so late.


E                                     
You can't overlook the lack, Jack, of any other highway to ride,
     E                                   
It's got no signs or dividing lines, and very few rules to guide.
  E
I spent a little time on the mountain, spent a little time on the hill,
  E
I saw things gettin out of hand but I guess they always will.
E                                          
Now I don't know but I've been told if the horse don't pull you got to 
A
carry the load.
E                                      G          D      A
I don't know whose back`s that strong; maybe find out before too long.

E                                                                
One way or another, one way or another, one way or another, 
this darkness has got to give.
