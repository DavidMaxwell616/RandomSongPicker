  We're playing these mind games together
                 Fmaj7  C/E      D     D/C
  pushing the barriers planting seeds.
  playing the mind guerrila chanting the mantra
  peace on earth.
  We all been  playing those mind games forever
  some kinda druid dudes lifting the veil.
  Doing the mind guerilla
  some call it magic the search for the grail.

  Love is the answer and you know that        for sure.
  Love is a   flower  you gotta let it you gotta let it grow


  So keep  on playing those mind games together
  faith in the future  outta the now.
  You just can't beat on those mind guerilla
  Absolute elsewhere in the stones of your mind.
  Yeah we're playing those mind games forever
  projecting our images in space and in time.

  Yes is the answer and you know that  for sure..
  Yes is surrender you gotta let it you gotta let it go.

  So keep  on playing those mind games together
  doing the ritual dance in the sun.
  Millions of mind guerillas
  putting the soul power to the Karmic wheel.
  Keep on playing those mind games forever
  raising the spirits of peace and love.

   C        G6/B    Am  C/G  Fmaj 7 C/E  D  D/C
  Love
  I want you to make love , not war,
  i know you've heard it before.
