                            BABY I LOVE YOUR WAY

    G                Bm          Em                C        F7
 SHADOWS GROW SO LONG BEFORE MY EYES, AND THEY'RE MOVING, ACROSS THE PAGE
    G            Bm            Em   C                   F7
 SUDDENLY THE DAY TURNS INTO NIGHT, FAR AWAY, FROM THE CITY
     Bm         E7                Am          D7
 BUT DON'T, HESITATE, CAUSE YOUR LOVE, WON'T WAIT


 CHORUS:
         G       D                   Am
            OOH, BABY I LOVE YOUR WAY
         G       D                   Am
            WANNA TELL YOU I LOVE YOUR WAY
         G       D                   Am
            WANNA BE WITH YOU NIGHT AND DAY


  G                  Bm                Em            C             F7
 MOON APPEARS TO SHINE, AND LIGHT THE SKY, WITH THE HELP, OF SOME FIREFLY
  G               Bm                  Em
 WONDER HOW THEY HAVE, THE POWER TO SHINE, SHINE, SHINE
         C         F7
 I CAN SEE THEM, UNDER THE PINE
     Bm         E7                Am          D7
 BUT DON'T, HESITATE, CAUSE YOUR LOVE, WON'T WAIT


 CHORUS:


 G              Bm             Em              C         F7
 I CAN SEE THE SUNSET IN YOUR EYES, BROWN AND GREY, AND BLUE BESIDES
 G                  Bm                 EM                C               F7
 CLOUDS ARE STALKING ISLANDS IN THE SUN, I WISH I COULD BUY ONE, OUT OF SEASON
     Bm         E7                Am          D7
 BUT DON'T, HESITATE, CAUSE YOUR LOVE, WON'T WAIT
