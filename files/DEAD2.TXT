The Complete Grateful Dead Lyrics

There is more than just lyrics here, I have also included inline guitar 
chord transcriptions, some from where I first got the lyrics, and others 
that I have managed to figure out by ear.  The page itself is divided into 
sections by the first letters of each song.

Down in the valley of the shadow, just you, Alabama, and me.

[Jam on 1st half of verse chords]

You may be saturday's child, all alone, moving with a tinge of grace.
You may be a clown in the burying ground or just another pretty face.
You may meet the fate of Ophelia, sleeping and perchance to dream.
Honest to the point of recklessness, self-centered in the extreme.

[Jam on 1st half of verse chords]

Ain't nobody messing with you but you.
Your friends are getting most concerned.
Loose with the truth baby, it's your fire.
But baby, I hope you don't get burned.
When the smoke has cleared she said, that's what she said to me.
Gonna want a bed to lay your head and a little sympathy.

[Jam on 1st half of verse chords]

D      G -> E
There are things you can replace and others you cannot.
D      G  -> E
The time has come to weigh those things; this space is getting hot.
  E->BmA  E
You know this space is getting hot.

[Jam on 1st half of verse chords]

I told Althea I'm a roving son, and I was born to be a bachelor.
Althea told me, okay, that's fine.
You know now I'm trying to catch her.
Can't talk to you without talking to me,
We're guilty of the same old thing.
Been talking alot about less and less
And forgetting the love we bring.

And We Bid You Goodnight  [Traditional]

    G
Lay down my dear brother, lay down and take your rest,
 D
Won't you lay your head upon your savior's breast?

I love you all but Jesus loves you the best

And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight.
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight.

Walking in Jerusalem just like John (goodnight, goodnight)
I would never ride, well, I would never ride  (goodnight, goodnight)
But His rod and His staff, they comfort me (goodnight, goodnight)
Tell "A" for the ark, that wonderful boat (goodnight, goodnight)
Tell "B" for the beast at the ending of the wood (goodnight,goodnight)
You know it ate all the children when they wouldn't be good,
Walking in Jerusalem just like John (goodnight, goodnight)
I go walking in the valley of the shadow of death,
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight.

Lay down my dear brother, lay down and take your rest,
Won't you lay your head upon your savior's breast?
I love you all but Jesus loves you the best
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight.
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight.



Attics of My Life  [Garcia/Hunter] (GD1)

E      A     E     AE  B   A E
In the attics of my life, full of cloudy dreams unreal.

Full of tastes no tongue can know, and lights no eyes can see.
E    B     A      E A    E AAE  A
When there was no ear to hear, you sang to me.

E      A E    AE B AE
I have spent my life seeking all that's still unsung.

Bent my ear to hear the tune, and closed my eyes to see.

When there was no strings to play, you played to me.

B      A    D  A  E
In the book of love's own dream, where all the print is blood.
A     D    B   A E
Where all the pages are my days, and all the lights grow old.
A D A E     D  B     A E    D   A E
When I had no wings to fly, you flew to me, you flew to me. To me.

A      E      A EAE B      A    E
In the secret space of dreams, where I dreaming lay amazed.

When the secrets all are told, and the petals all unfold.
E    B     A      E A      E AA   E   (A E)
When there was no dream of mine, you dreamed of me.



Beat it on Down The Line  [J.Fuller]

Well this job I've got is just a little too hard,
Running out of money, Lord, I need more pay.
Gonna wake up in the morning Lord, gonna pack my bags,
I'm gonna beat it on down the line.
I'm goin' down the line, goin down the line,
Goin' down the line, goin down the line,
Goin' down the line, goin down the line,
Beat it on down the line.

Yes I'll be waiting at the station Lord, when that train pulls on by,
I'm going back where I belong.
I'm going back to that same old used-to-be,
Down in Joe Brown's coal mine.

Coal mine, coal mine, coal mine, coal mine.
Coal mine, coal mine, coal mine, coal mine.
Coal mine, coal mine, coal mine, coal mine.
Down in Joe Brown's coal mine.

Yeah, I'm goin' back to that shack way across that railroad track,
Uh huh, that's where I think I belong.
I got a sweet woman Lord, she's waitin' there for me,
And that's where I'm gonna make my happy home.

Happy home, happy home, happy home, happy home.
Happy home, happy home, happy home, happy home.
Happy home, happy home, happy home, happy home.
That's where I'm gonna make my happy home.

Bertha don't you come around here anymore.

Dressed myself in green, I went down unto the sea.
Try to see what's goin' down, try to read between the lines.
I had a feelin' I was fallin', fallin', fallin',
I turned around to see,
Heard a voice a' callin', Lord you was comin' after me.

Ran into a rainstorm, ducked into a bar door.
It's all night pourin', pourin' rain, Lord but not a drop on me.

Throw me in the jailhouse,
Lord until the sun goes down ('till it goes down).

Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.

Tears I cried for that woman are gonna  flood you big river,

And I'm a gonna sit right here 'til I die.

I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota,

Well I heard my dream went back downstream, cavortin' in Davenport,
And I follow you big river when you called.

[Chorus]
[Jam]

Well I followed her down to St. Louie, later on down the river,
Trader said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone.
Well I followed her down to Memphis, but she just walked off the bus,
She raised a few eyebrows and she went on down alone.

[Chorus]
[Jam]

Well I've gotten on down to Baton Rouge, River Queen roll on,
Take that woman down to New Orleans, New Orleans.
I give up, I've had enough, followed my blues on down to the gulf,
She loves you big river more than me.

And I'm a gonna sit right here 'til I die.
And I'm a gonna sit right here 'til I die.

Bird Song  [Garcia/Hunter]

If you hear that same sweet song again, will you know why?

Black Muddy River  [Garcia/Hunter]

When the last rose of summer pricks my finger,
And the hot sun chills me to the bone,
When I can't hear the song for the singer,
And I can't tell my pillow from a stone,
I will walk alone by the black muddy river,
And sing me a song of my own,
I will walk alone by the black muddy river,
And sing me a song of my own.

When the last bolt of sunshine hits the mountain,
And the stars start to splatter in the sky,
When the moon hits the southwest horizon,
With the scream of an eagle on the fly,
I will walk alone by the black muddy river,
And listen to the ripples as they moan,
I will walk alone by the black muddy river,
And sing me a song of my own.

Black muddy river, roll on forever,
I don't care how deep or wide, if you've got another side,
Roll muddy river, roll muddy river, black muddy river, roll.

When it seems like the night will last forever,
And there's nothing left to do but count the years,
When the strings of my heart begin to sever,
And stones fall from my eyes instead of tears,
I will walk alone, by the black muddy river,
And dream me a dream of my own,
I will walk alone, by the black muddy river,
And sing me a song of my own, sing me a song of my own.


Black Peter  [Garcia/Hunter] (GD1)

[Intro: A7]

     A7    D7
All of my friends come to  see me last night,
     A7      D7
I was laying in my bed and dying.
     Em  Bm   A   G F#m Em  D7
Annie Bonneau from Saint Angel say the  weather down here so fine.

|D7 . . .|. . . .|A7 . . .|. . . .|

Just then the wind came squalling through the dark,
But who can the weather command?
Just want to have a little peace to die,
And a friend or two I love at hand.

|D7 . . .|. . . .|A7 . . .|. . . .|

[Jam on verse chords]

Fever roll up to a hundred and five.
Roll on up, gonna roll back down.
One more day I find myself alive,
Tomorrow maybe go beneath the ground.

|D7 . . .|. . . .|. . . .|. . . .|

[Bridge]
      C   Em
See here how everything lead up to this day,
     Dm     Am    Em
And it's just like any other day that's  ever been.
     Dm   G C   Em    Am
Sun going up and then the sun going down.
  Fmaj7   C     D7
Shine through my window and my friends, they come around,
      Dm    Fmaj7   A7
Come around, come around.

The people might know, but the people don't care
That a man can be as poor as me.
Take a look at poor Peter, he's lying in pain,
Now let's come run and see, run and see,
Run and see, run, run and see, and see.

[Jam on D7]


Black Throated Wind  [Weir/Barlow]

[Intro: E]

      E  F#m
You're bringing me down,  I'm running aground,
      D      A      E
Blind in the lights of the interstate cars,
      E      F#m
Passing me by,  the busses and semis,
      DA  E
Plunging like stones from a slingshot on mars.

      A Bm   C#m  A D     C#mBm   A
But I'm here by the road,   bound   to the load,
     Bm     E
That I picked up in ten thousand cafes and bars.
      A Bm     C#m  A     D      C#m Bm A
Alone with the rush of the drivers that won't pick me up,
     Bm     E
The highway, the moon, and clouds and the stars.

     /D     C#m  A
Black throated wind,  keeps on pourin' in,
   Em      C A
With its words of a life where nothing is new,
      D     C#m  A  Em A
Ah, Mother American Night,   I blast from the light,
      G   D    A
Oh Lord, and I'm drownin' in you.

I left St. Louis, the City of Blues,
In the midst of a storm I'd rather forget.
I tried to pretend it came to an end,
Cause you weren't the woman I once thought I'd met.

But I can't deny, times have gone by,
I never had doubts or thoughts of regret,
And I was a man, when all this began,
Who'd never think twice about being there yet.

Black throated wind, whisper with sin,
And speaks of a life that passes like dew.
It's forced me to see, you've done better by me,
Done better by me than I've done by you.

Now what's to be found, racing around,
You carry your pain wherever you go.
All full of the blues, and tryin' to lose,
You ain't gonna learn what you don't wanna know.

So I give you my eyes, and all of their lies,
Please help them to learn as well as to see.
And capture a glance, oh, Lord, and make it dance,
Of looking at you, looking at me.

Black throated wind, keeps on pourin' in,
With its words of a lie that could almost be true.
Ah, Mother American Night, burst from the light.
I'm turning around, that's what I'm gonna do.

      G D    A
Well I'm going back home that's what I'm gonna do.
I'm turning around, that's what I'm gonna do.
Lord I'm going back home that's what I'm gonna do.
Cause you done better by me than I've done by you,
Say whoa and I'm drowning in you.
I'm going, going, going back home, that's what I'm gonna do.
Going, going, going back home that's what I'm gonna do.
Well you done better by me then I've done by you,
So whoa, lord, and I'm drowning in you.
Going, going, going back home that's what I'm gonna do.
Well you done better by me then I've done by you,
Whoa, lord, and I'm drowning in you.
Whoa, lord, and I'm drowning in you.



Blues For Allah  [Garcia/Hunter] (GD2)

Arabian wind, The needle's eye is thin,
The ships of state sail on mirage,
And drown in sand, Out in no-man's land where Allah does command.

What good is spilling blood?  It will not grow a thing;
Taste eternity the swords sing: Blues of Allah In 'sh'Allah.

They lie where they fall,  There's nothing more to say,
The desert stars are bright tonight lets meet as friends,
The Flower of Islam, The Fruit of Abraham.

The thousand stories have come round to one again,
Arabian night, Our Gods pursue their fight,
What fatal flowers of darkness bloom from seeds of light.

Bird of paradise fly in white sky, Blues for Allah In 'sh'Allah,
Let's see with our heart, These things our eyes have seen,
And know the truth must still lie somewhere in between.

Under eternity, under eternity, under eternity blue,
Bird of paradise fly in white sky, Blues for Allah In 'sh'Allah.



Born Cross-Eyed  [Weir] (GDA)

Seems like I've been here before,
Fuzzy then and still so obscure, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
And I don't want to see anybody cry,
Meet me some mornin' in the sweet by and by, by and by, by and by.

Song comin' on,
So pleasin' to see, come and gone, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,
You don't have to tell me why,
Meet me some mornin' in the sweet by and by, by and by, by and by.

It ain't cause I'm the only one left darlin',
Bout the time the sun rises west,
Feelin' groovy, lookin' fine.

Think I'll come back here again,
Every now and then from time to time.
My how lovely you are, my dear,
The ball game has gone much too far my dear,
Sing to me, do your thing to me,
I'll meet you some mornin', meet you some mornin',
In the sweet by and by, by and by, by and by.

Around some corner where it's been waiting to meet you.

What do you want me to do, to watch for you while you're sleeping?
     AmCG      D

Look into any eyes you find by you; you can see clear to another day.
Maybe been seen before,
Through other eyes on other days while going home.

What do you want me to do, to do for you to see you through?
     CEm D    G
It's all a dream we dreamed one afternoon, long ago.

Walk into splintered sunlight,
Inch your way through dead dreams to another land.
Maybe you're tired and broken,
Your tongue is twisted with words half spoken and thoughts unclear.

A box of rain will ease the pain, and love will see you through.

Believe it if you need in, if you don't just pass it on.

In and out the window like a moth  before a flame.

Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul.

River goin' to take me, sing sweet and sleepy,
Sing me sweet and sleepy all the way back home.
It's a far gone lullaby sung many years ago.
Mama, Mama, many worlds I've come since I first left home.

Goin' home, goin' home, by the waterside I will rest my bones.
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul.

Going to plant a weeping willow;
On the bank's green edge it will grow, grow, grow.
Singin' a lullaby beside the water
Lovers come and go, the river roll, roll, roll.

Fare you well, fare you well, I love you more than words can tell.
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul.
I'm gonna listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul.


Brother Esau  [Weir/Barlow]

My brother Esau killed the hunter, back in 1969,
Before the killing was done his inheritance was mine.
When at first my brother walked away,
Before a weary band,
Esau gave his sleeplessness for a piece of moral land.

Our father favored Esau, he was eager to obey,
All the wild commandments, the old man shot his way.
But all this ended when, my brother failed at war,
He staggered home and found me in the door.

Esau skates on mirrors anymore
Meets his pale reflection at the door.
Sometimes at night I dream, he's still that hairy man,
Shadow boxing the apocalypse, wandering the land.

Esau holds the blessing, brother Esau holds the curse,
I was thinking that the blame was mine,
But suspected something worse.
The more my brother looks like me, the more I understand,
The silent war it bloodied both our hands.
Sometimes at night I think I understand.
None of us can win.
Outside that dream, still that hairy man.
Well sometimes at night I think I understand.
Shadowboxing the apocalypse, wandering the land.

And it looks like the old man's gettin' on.

1920 when he stepped to the bar, drank to the dregs of the whiskey jar
1930 when the wall caved in. He'd made his way selling red-eyed gin.

[Chorus]

Delilah Jones was the mother of twins,
Two times over and the rest were sins.
Raised eight boys, only I turned bad,
Didn't get the lickin's that the other ones had.

Tumble-down shack in Big Foot County.

Snowed so hard that the roof caved in.

Delilah Jones went to meet her god,

And the old man never was the same again.

Daddy made whiskey and he made it well.
Cost two dollars and it burned like hell.
I cut hick'ry just to fire the still,
Drink down a bottle and be ready to kill.

[Chorus]

Gone are the days when the ox fall down,
Take up the yoke and plow the fiends around.
Gone are the days when the ladies said' "Please,
Gentle Jack Jones won't you come to me."

And it looks like the old man's getting on.

To say "How do you do?" before we're left behind.

Who can stop what must arrive now? Something new is waiting to be born
Dark as the night you're still by my side; shine inside.

Gone both dream and lie.

Never could reach it, just slips away but I try. |G . . .|Gsus4 . . .|


Cream Puff War  [Garcia] (GDA)

No, no!  She can't take your mind and leave
I know it's just another trick she's got up her sleeve
I can't believe that she really wants you to die
After all it's more than enough to pay for your lie

Wait a minute, watch what you're doin' with your time
All the endless ruins of the past must stay behind, yeah

Well, can't you see that you're killing each other's soul
Well, you're both out in the streets and you got no place to go
Your constant battes are getting to be a bore
So go somewhere else and continue your cream puff war




Cryptical Envelopment  [Garcia/Hunter] (GDA)

The other day they waited, the sky was dark and faded,
Solemnly they stated, "He has to die, you know he has to die."
All the children learnin', from books that they were burnin',
Every leaf was turnin' ; to watch him die, you know he had to die.

The summer sun looked down on him, his mother could but frown on him,
And all the others sound on him, but it doesn't seem to matter.

And when the day had ended, with rainbow colors blended,
His mind remained unbended, he had to die, you know he had to die.

And when the day had ended, with rainbow colors blended,
Their minds remained unbended,
He had to die, Oh, you know he had to die.

 Dark Star  [The Dead/Hunter] (GDA)

 Dark star crashes, pouring its light into ashes.
 Reason tatters, the forces tear loose from the axis.
 Searchlight casting for faults in the clouds of delusion.
 Shall we go, you and I while we can
 Through the transitive nightfall of diamonds?

 Mirror shatters in formless reflections of matter.
 Glass hand dissolving to ice petal flowers revolving.
 Lady in velvet recedes in the nights of goodbye.
 Shall we go, you and I while we can
 Through the transitive nightfall of diamonds?


 Day Job  [Garcia/Hunter]

 Maybe you collect or maybe you pay (whether)
 Still got to work that eight hour day
 Whether you like that job or not
 You'd better keep it on ice while you're lining up your long shot

 Which is to say, hey hey, keep yer day job
 Don't give it away, keep yer day job, whatever they say
 Keep yer day job 'till your night job pays.

 Steady boys starting that eight day hour
 Never underrate that paycheck power
 By now you know that the face on your dollar
 Got a thumb on its nose and a hand on your collar
 With a chance to say, hey hey, keep yer day job.

 Daddy may drive a V-8 'Vette
 Mama may bathe in champagne yet
 God bless the child that's got his own stash
 Nine to five and a place to crash
 which is to say...

 Sunday comes forget about work,
 Ring that bell for whatever it's worth.
 If you ask me like I know you won't
 I'll tell you what to do what I know that you won't.

 But the cards were all the same.
 Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me.
 Please, don't murder me.

 Maybe take my supper, eat it down by the sea.
 Gave my babe twenty or forty good reasons,
 Couldn't find any better ones in the morning at three.

 Steppin' off sharply from the rank and file.
 Awful cold and dark like a dungeon
 Maybe get a little bit darker before the day.

 Dupree's Diamond Blues  [Garica/Lesh/Hunter]

 D7  Gm
 When I was just a little young boy,
 C  F
 Papa said, "Son, you'll never get far,
      D7 Gm
 I'll tell you the reason, if you wanna know,
 C      Bb    Bbm  C7     F
 'Cause child of mine, there isn't really very far to go."

 Well, baby, baby wants a gold diamond ring,
 Wants it more than most any old thing.
 Well, when I get those jelly roll blues,
 Why, I'd go and get anything in this world for you.

 And down to the jewelry store packin' a gun,
 Says, "Wrap it up I think I'll take this one."
 "A thousand dollars, please," the jewelry man said.
 Dupree said, "I'll pay this one off to you in lead."

 [Bridge]
 F      C     Bb F
 Well you know son, you just can't figure.
 C Gm     F    C    Bb  G7
 First thing you know you're gonna to pull that trigger,
 F   C    D7
 And it's no wonder, your reason goes bad.
 GmC F
 Jelly roll will drive you stone mad.

 Judge said, "Son, it's gonna cost you some time."
 Dupree said, "Judge, you know that crossed my mind."
 Judge said, "In fact, it's gonna cost you your life."
 Dupree said, "Judge, you know, that seems to me to be about right."

 Well, baby, baby you gonna lose her sweet man.
 Dupree come out with a losin' hand.
 Baby's gonna weave it up for a while,
 Then go out and find another sweet man's gonna cheat her with style.

 Judge said, "Son, I know your baby well,
 But not to say to her that I can never tell."
 Dupree said, "Judge, well, it's well understood,
 And you got to admit that sweet, sweet Jelly's so good."

 [Bridge]

 Same old story, and I know it's been told.
 Some like jelly jelly, some like gold.
 Many a man's done a terrible thing
 Just to get baby a shiny diamond ring.


 

 Easy Wind  [Hunter] (GD1)

 Been chippin' up rocks for the great highway.

 Easy wind going cross the Bayou today.
 There's a whole lotta women
 Out on the streets in red today;
 And the river keeps a-talkin',
 But you never heard a word it said.


 The Eleven  [Lesh/Hunter]

 High green chilly winds and windy vines
 In loops around the twined shafts of lavender,
 They're crawling to the sun.

 Underfoot the ground is patched
 With climbing arms of ivy wrapped around the manzanita,
 Stark and shiny in the breeze.

 Wonder who will water all the children of the garden
 When they sigh about the barren lack of rain and
 Droop so hungry 'neath the sky.

 William Tell has stretched his bow till it won't stretch
 No furthermore and/or it may require a change
 That hasn't come before.

 No more time to tell how, this is the season of what,
 Now is the time of returning with our thought
 Jewels polished and gleaming.
 Now is the time past believing the child has relinquished the rein,
 Now is the test of the boomerang tossed in the night of redeeming.

 Eight sided whispering hallelujah hatrack,
 Seven faced marble eyed transitory dream doll,
 Six proud walkers on the jingle bell rainbow,
 Five men writing with fingers of gold,
 Four men tracking down the great white sperm whale,
 Three girls waiting in a foreign dominion
 Riding in the whalebelly, fade away in moonlight,
 Sink beneath the waters to the coral sands below.


 El Paso  [Marty Robbins]

 DG
 Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
 A D
 I fell in love with a Mexican girl.
 D     G
 Nighttime would find me in Rose's Cantina,
 A     D
 Music would play and Felina would whirl.

 D      G
 Black as the night were the eyes of Felina,
 A   D
 Wicked and evil while casting a spell.
 D      G
 My love was strong for this Mexican maiden,
 A      D    D7
 I was in love, but in vain I could tell.

 [Bridge]
 G     D
 One night a wild young cowboy came in, wild as the West Texas wind.
 D
 Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing,
  G    A
 With wicked Felina, the girl that I love, so in anger

 I challenged his right for the love of this maiden;
 Down went his hand for the gun that he wore.
 My challenge was answered, in less than a heartbeat
 The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor.

 Just for a moment I stood there in silence,
 Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done.
 Many thoughts ran through my mind as I stood there;
 I had but one chance and that was to run.

 [Bridge]
 Out through the back door of Rose's I ran,
 Out where the horses were tied.
 I picked a good one; he looked like he could run,
 Up on his back and away I did ride, just as fast as I

 Could from the West Texas town of El Paso,
 Out thru the badlands of New Mexico.
 Back in El Paso my life would be worthless;
 Everything's gone in life nothing is left.

 [Jam]

 But it's been so long since I've seen the young maiden,
 My love is stronger that my fear of death.

 [Bridge]
 I saddled up and away I did go, riding alone in the dark.
 Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me,
 Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart, & as last here I

 Am on the hill overlooking El Paso,
 I can see Rose's Cantina below.
 My love is strong and it pushes me onward,
 Down off the hill to Felina I go.

 Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys,
 Off to my left ride a dozen or more.
 Shouting and shooting; I can't let them catch me,
 I've got to make it to Rose's back door.

 [Bridge]
 Something is dreadfully wrong for I a feel
 A deep burning pain in my side.
 It's getting harder to stay in the saddle.
 I'm getting weary, unable to ride, but my love for

 Felina is strong and I rise where I've fallen;
 Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest.
 I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle,
 I feel the bullet go deep in my chest.

 From out of nowhere, Felina has found me,
 Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side.
 Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for,
 One little kiss and Felina goodbye.

 Fire On The Mountain  [Garcia/Hunter] (GDA)

 [Intro: |B . . .|. . . .|A . . .|. . . .|]

B   A
 Long distance runner, what you standin' there for?
BA
 Get up, get out, get out of the door.
B     A
 You're playin' cold music on the barroom floor,
B A
 Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core.
B  A
 There's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town.
B A
 Takes a whole pail of water just to cool him down.

 [Chorus]
 B   A
 Fire, fire on the mountain. 4x

 Almost ablaze, still you don't feel the heat.
 It takes all you got just to stay on the beat.
 You say it's a livin'; we all gotta eat.
 But you're here alone; there's no one to compete.
 If Mercy's in bus'ness, I wish it for you.
 More than just ashes when your dreams come true.

 [Chorus]
 [Jam]

 Long distance runner, what you holdin' out for?
 Caught in slow motion in a dash to the door.
 The flame from your stage has now spread to the floor.
 You gave all you had. Why you want to give more?
 The more that you give, the more it will take
 To the thin line beyond which you really can't fake.

 [Chorus]



 Franklin's Tower  [Garcia/Kreutzmann/Hunter] (GDA,GD2)

 In another time's forgotten space
 Your eyes looked from your mother's face
 Wallflower seed on the sand and stone
 May the four winds blow you safely home.

 Roll away the dew
 Roll away the dew
 Roll away the dew
 Roll away the dew

 I'll tell you where the four winds dwell
 In Franklin's tower there hangs a bell
 It can ring, turn night to day
 It can ring like fire when you lose your way.

 Roll away the dew
 Roll away the dew
 Roll away the dew
 Roll away the dew

 God save the child that rings that bell
 It may have one good ring, baby, you can't tell
 One watch by night, one watch by day
 If you get confused listen to the music play.

 [jam]

 Some come to laugh their past away
 Some come to make it just one more day
 Whichever way your pleasure tends
 If you plant ice you're gonna harvest the wind.

 Roll away the dew
 Roll away the dew
 Roll away the dew
 Roll away the dew

 In Franklin's tower the four winds sleep
 Like four lean hounds the lighthouse keep
 Wildflower seed on the sand and wind
 May the four winds blow you home again.

 Roll away the dew
 Roll away the dew
 Roll away the dew
 You'd better roll away the dew

 Roll away the dew
 Roll away the dew
 Roll away the dew
 You'd better roll away the dew - roll away.

 Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
 I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills.

 I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there.
 He took my twenty dollar bill and he vanished in the air.

 Second one is prison, baby, the sheriff's on my trail,

 Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee.
 The first one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me.

 The Golden Road  [McGannahan Skjellyfetti] (GDA)

 See that girl, barefootin' along,
 Whistlin' and singin', she's a carryin' on.
 There's laughing in her eyes, dancing in her feet,
 She's a neon-light diamond, she can live on the street.

 Hey hey, hey, come right away
 Come and join the party every day.

 Well everybody's dancin' in a ring around the sun
 Nobody's finished, we ain't even begun.
 So take off your shoes, child, and take off your hat.
 Try on your wings and find our where it's at.

 Hey hey, hey, come right away
 Come and join the party every day.

 Take a vacation, fall out for a while,
 Summer's comin' in, and it's goin' outa style
 Well, lie down smokin', honey, have yourself a ball
 Cause your mother's down in Memphis, won't be back 'till the fall.

 Hey hey, hey, come right away
 Come and join the party every day.

 I'm telling you so you can tell the rest what you've been through.

 Don't you turn around, no, don't look after you
 It's not your business how it's done, you're lucky to get through
 You're a good upstanding man, a credit to the flock
 But if you don't face straight ahead you could not take the shock
 Blew the city off the map, left nothing there but fire
 The wife of Lot got turned to salt, because she looked behind her.

 Hell in a Bucket  [Weir/Barlow]

 Well I was drinkin' last night with a biker
 And I showed him a picture of you
 I said, "Pal get to know her, you'll like her
 Seemed like the least I could do.
 Cause when he's chargin' his chopper
 Up and down your carpeted halls
 You will think me, by contrast, quite proper
 Never mind how I stumble and fall.

 You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot
 For a taste of your elegant pride
 I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe
 But at least I'm enjoying the ride, at least I'll enjoy the ride.

 Cause you're a sweet little softcore pretender
 Somehow, babe, it got as hot as it gets
 With her black leather gold spike suspenders
 And your chain, your black whip and pets.

 Well we know you're the reincarnation
 Of the revernous Catherine the Great
 And we know how you love the ovation
 And the scene that it seems to create.

 You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot
 For taste of your elegant pride
 I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe
 But at least I'm enjoying the ride, at least I'll enjoy the ride.

 You analyze me, attempt to despise me
 And you laugh when I stumble and fall
 There may come a day when I'll dance on your grave
 Unable to dance I'll still crawl across it
 Unable to dance I'll still crawl
 Unable to dance I'll still crawl
 Unable to dance I'll crawl.

 You must really consider the circus
 It just might be your kind of zoo
 I can't think of a place that's more perfect
 For a person as perfect as you.

 And it's not like I'm leaving you lonely
 Cause I wouldn't know where to begin
 Well I know you wake up here only
 When the snakes come marching in.

 You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot
 For taste of your elegant pride
 I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe
 But at least I'm enjoying the ride, at least I'll enjoy the ride.

 Ride, ride, ride
 Ride, ride, ride
 Ride, ride, ride
 At least I'm enjoyin' the ride (etc.)

 Crippled but free, I was blind all the time I was learning to see

 Help on the way, well, I know only this, I've got you today.
 Don't fly away, cause I love what I love and I want it that way.
 I will stay one more day, like I say, honey it's you.
 Making it too, without love in a dream it will never come true (leia)

 His face like a jewel and he was dead
 He liked to play games or push me on a swing
 Or push me on a merry-go-round, so round and round


 Hey Little One  [Bernette/Vorzon]

 Hey, hey little one I'm just like you I'm lonely too

 Hey, hey little one don't go away, tell me you'll stay
 Tell me, tell me, tell me you'll stay

 I Need A Miracle  [Weir/Barlow]

 A lady of nobility, gentility and rage
 Splendor in the dark, lightning on the draw
 We'll go right through the book and break each and every law.

 I got a feeling and it won't go away, oh no
B
 Just one thing and I got to say
      E7|E7 . . .| 4x
 I need a miracle every day.

 I need a woman 'bout twice my height
 Statuesque, raven-dressed, a goddess of the night.
 Her secret incantations, a candle burning blue
 We'll consult the spirits maybe they'll know what to do.

 And it's real and it won't go away, oh no
 I can't get around it and I can't run away
 I need a miracle every day.

 I need a woman 'bout twice my weight
 A ton of fun who packs a gun with all her other freight
 Find her in a sideshow, leave her in L.A.
 Ride her like a surfer, running on a tidal wave.

 And it's real, believe it today, yeah
 One thing, well I got to say, I need a miracle every day.

B
 It takes dynamite to get me up
      E7
 Too much of everything is just enough

 One more thing I just got to say

 I need a miracle every day. [key change]

 I need a miracle every day (everyday).

 It Must Have Been The Roses  [Garcia/Hunter] (GDA)

 Annie laid her head down in the roses.
 She had ribbons, ribbons, ribbons, in her long brown hair.
 I don't know, maybe it was the roses,
 All I know I could not leave her there.

 I don't know, it must have been the roses,
 The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair.
 I don't know, maybe it was the roses,
 All I know I could not leave her there.

 Ten years the waves roll the ships home from the sea,
 Thinkin' well how it may blow in all good company,
 If I tell another what your own lips told to me,
 Let me lay 'neath the roses, till my eyes no longer see.

 I don't know, it must have been the roses,
 The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair.
 I don't know, maybe it was the roses,
 All I know I could not leave her there.

 One pane of glass in the window,
 No one is complaining, no, come in and shut the door,
 Faded is the crimson from the ribbons that she wore,
 And it's strange how no one comes round any more.

 I don't know, it must have been the roses,
 The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair.
 I don't know, maybe it was the roses,
 All I know I could not leave her there.

 Annie laid her head down in the roses.
 She had ribbons, ribbons, ribbons, in her long brown hair.
 I don't know, maybe it was the roses,
 All I know I could not leave her there.

 Leavin' Texas, fourth day out of July,
 Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky.
 Catch the Detroit Lightnin' out of Sante Fe,
 The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea.

 Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride.
 Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride.
 There ain't a place a man can hide, Shannon
 Will keep him from the sun
 Ain't a bed can give us rest now, you keep us on the run.

 Jack Straw from Wichita cut his buddy down,
 And dug for him a shallow grave and laid his body down.
 Half a mile from Tucson, by the morning light,
 One man gone and another to go,
 My old buddy you're moving much too slow.

 We can share the women, we can share the wine.


 Lazy Lightning  [Weir/Barlow]

 Lazy lightnin' sleepy fire in your eyes
 It's like desire in disguise
 I keep on tryin' but I, I can't get through
 Lazy lightnin' I'd like to find the proper potion
 That's gonna capture your emotion
 You're right beside me but I, I can't get through

 You're a loop of lazy lightnin', just a loop of lazy lightnin'
 Must admit you're kinda frightnin' but you really get me high
 So exciting, when I hear your velvet thunder,
 You seem so near I start to wonder
 Would you come closer if, if I asked you to?

 So inviting, the way you're messing with my reason
 It's an exception but it's pleasing
 Tell me a lie and I will swear, I'll swear it's true.

 You're a loop of lazy lightnin' (Lazy lightnin')
 Just a loop of lazy lightnin' (Lazy lightnin')
 Must admit you're kinda frightening
 Just a loop of lazy lightnin'
 Put the fire in my eyes (Lightnin')
 Put the fire every time (Lightnin')
 Put the fire in my heart (Lightnin')
 Well come on lazy lightning.
 Just a loop of lazy lightning

 Misty lightning, well you always electrify me
 Someday I know you'll satisfy me
 And all that lightnin' will be my lightnin' too.
 My lightnin' too.  (My lightnin' too)
 Just a loop of lazy lightnin' (My lightnin' too)
 My lightnin' too.  (My lightnin' too)
 Just a loop of lazy lightnin' (My lightnin' too)
 My lightnin' too.  (My lightnin' too)
 Oh come on lazy lightnin' (My lightnin' too)




 Let It Grow (Weather Report Suite Part II)  [Weir/Barlow] (GD2)

     Am7G#o7
 Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore;
     Am7    G#o7
 Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door.
      Am    C Am   C   Bm D
 See the sun sparkle in the reeds; silver beads pass into the sea.

     D     A7
 She comes from a town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter;
A7   D
 She's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water,
  D  Bm
 And she bears it away with a love that the river has taught her.
      Am      C6Em/F#
 Let it flow, greatly flow, wide and clear.

 Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed field;
 Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal.
 Broken ground open and beckoning to the spring;
 Black dirt live again.

 The plowman is broad as the back of the land he is sowing,
 As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
 That the work of his day measures more than the planting and growing.
 Let it grow, let it grow, greatly yield.

 [Bridge]
     Em/F#     B      G     Em/F#
 What shall we say, shall we call it by a name,
    C     G    Bm7
 As well to count the angels dancing on a pin.
     Em/F#   B  G Em/F#
 Water bright as the sky from which it came

 [E D A F#m7 E]

 Did you ever wake unto to the sound, of street cats making love?
 And guess from their cries you were listening to a fight.
 Well you know, hate's just the last thing they're thinking of.
 They're only tryin' to make it through the night.

 [Jam on bridge chords]

 I only want to hold you, I don't want to tie you down
 Or paint you in the lines I might've drawn.
 It's just that I, have gotten used to havin' you around.
 The landscape would be empty, if you were gone.

 Mama Tried  [Merle Haggard]

 The first I remember knowin' was that lonesome whistle blowin'

 And a youngin's dream of growin' up to ride.

 On a freight train leavin' town, not knowin' where I was bound
    D    A D
 No one could steer me right, but mama tried.

 Was the only rebel child from a family meek and mild
 Mama seemed to know what lay in store
 In spite of all my Sunday learnin'
 For the bad I kept on turnin'
 And mama couldn't hold me anymore.

D     C    D
 And I turned 21 in prison, doin' life without parole

 No one could steer me right, but mama tried, mama tried

 Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleadin' I denied

 That leaves no one but me to blame cause mama tried.

 Dear old daddy rest his soul, left my mom a heavy load
 She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
 Workin' hours without rest, wanted me to have the best
 Oh she tried to raise me right, but I refused.

 No one could steer me right, but mama tried, mama tried
 Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleadin' I denied
 That leaves no one but me to blame cause mama tried.

 That leaves no one but me to blame cause mama tried.

 Mason's Children  [Garcia/Hunter]

 Mason died on Monday, we bricked him in the wall
 All his children grew and grew,
 They ain't never grown so tall before
 They may never grow so tall again

 We dug him up on Tuesday, he hardly aged a day
 Taught us all we ever knew,
 We ain't never known so much before
 We may never know so much again

 The wall collapsed on Wednesday, we chalked it up to fate
 Mason's children ran and flew,
 They ain't never run so fast before
 Swore they'd never show their face again

 Mason was a mighty man, a mighty man was he
 Always said when I'm dead I'm gone, don't you weep for me

 Thursday came then Friday, with buyers tall and bright
 Mason's children cooked the stew
 And cleaned up when the feast was through

 Take me to the repo-man to pay back what is owed
 If he's in some other land write it off as stole




 Me and My Uncle  [J.Phillips]

 [Intro: Em G B Em ]

  GEm G  Em
 Me and my uncle went ridin' down, South Colorado, West Texas bound.
 G     Em
 We stopped over in Santa Fe,
      G      A Asus4 A Asus4 A
 That bein' the point just about half way,
     Em    B     Em G B Em
 And you know it was the hottest part of the day.

   GEm
 I took the horses up to the stall,
     G Em
 Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all.
   GEm
 Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt,
 GA Asus4 A Asus4 A
 It bein' summer, I took off my shirt,
Em  B    Em  G B Em
 And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt.

 G      Em
 West Texas cowboys, they's all around,
     G    Em
 With liquor and money, they loaded down.
    G   Em
 So soon after payday, know it seemed a shame;
   G      A Asus4 A Asus4 A
 You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game,
 Em      B Em  G B Em
 High-low jack and the winner take the hand.

 [Jam]

 My uncle starts winnin'; cowboys got sore.
 One of them called him, and then two more,
 Accused him of cheatin'; Oh no, it couldn't be.
 I know my uncle, he's as honest as me,
 And I'm as honest as a Denver man can be.

 One of them cowboys, he starts to draw,
 And I shot him down, Lord, he never saw.
 Shot me another, oh damn he won't grow old.
 In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold,
 And we high-tailed it down to Mexico.

 I love those cowboys, I love their gold,
 I loved my uncle, God rest his soul,
 Taught me good, Lord, Taught me all I know
 Taught me so well, I grabbed that gold
Em  B     Em
 And I left his dead ass there by the side of the road.


 

 Mexicali Blues  [Weir/Barlow]

 [Intro: D A D]

 A      C    B     Em
 Laid back in an old saloon, with a peso in my hand,
 A      D
 Watchin' flies and children on the street,
A
 And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls
     C      B      Em
 Who giggle when I smile,
    A    D
 There's a little boy who wants to shine my feet.

   G      B
 And it's three days ride from Bakersfield
Em
 And I don't know why I came.
   A    D
 I guess I came to keep from payin' dues.
      G  B     Em
 So instead I've got a bottle and a girl who's just fourteen,
A
 And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues. Yeah.

 [Chorus]
 D
 Is there anything a man don't stand to lose,
 D  A
 When the devil wants to take it all away?
 A
 Cherish well your thoughts,
 A
 And keep a tight grip on your booze,
A    Em    A
 Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today.

 [Intro]

 She said her name was Billy Jean and she was fresh in town.
 I didn't know a stage line ran from Hell.
 She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold,
 All the french perfume you'd care to smell.

 She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear,
 "Go on, my friend, do anything you choose."
 Now I'm payin' for those happy hours
 I spent there in her arms,
 With a lifetime's worth of the Mexicali Blues.

 [Chorus]
 [Intro - repeat & jam]

 And then a man rode into town, some thought he was the law.
 Billy Jean was waitin' when he came.
 She told me he would take her, if I didn't use my gun,
 I'd have no one but myself to blame.

 I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind.
 I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news
 'Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord, he didn't even draw
 And now I spent my lifetime running with the Mexicali Blues.

 Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
 When he lets a woman hold him in her hands?
 He just might find himself out there on horseback in the dark
 Just ridin' and runnin' across those desert sands.


 

 Might As Well  [Garcia/Hunter]

 Great North Special, were you on board?
 F  Eb
 Can't find a ride like that no more.

 Night the chariot swung down low

 One long party from front to end
 Tune to the whistle going 'round the bend,
 No big hurry, what do you say?
 Might as well the elegant way.

 Ragtime solid for twenty-five miles
 Then switch over to the cajun style
 Bar car blowing rhythm and blues,
 Rock 'n' roll wailing in the old caboose.

 Long train running from coast to coast
 Bringing home a party when you need it the most
 Whup on the box car, beat on the bell
 Nothing else shaking so you might just as well.

 [Chorus]

    C GBb F
 Never had such a good time,    in my life before.

 I'd like to have it one time more,

 One good ride from start to end,
     A   Bb    F     F# G
 I'd like to take that ride again, again.

 [Jam on verse chords]

 Ran out of track and I caught the plane
 Back in the county with the blues again
 Great North Special been on my mind
 I might like to ride it just one more time.

 Cause we all need each other, well you know it's true

 But his little girl sure wish she would.

 Well now the doctor call me crazy, sometimes I am, sometimes I ain't,

 But his little girl call me saint.

 Well a couple shots of whiskey women round here start looking good,
 I said a couple shots of whiskey women round here start looking good.
 A couple more shots of whiskey, I'm going down to Minglewood.

 I was born in the desert, raised in a lion's den.
 Said, I was born in the desert, raised in a lion's den.
 Yes and my number one occupation is stealing women from their men.
 And I'll do it, do it again.
 Oh, my number one occupation is stealing women from their men.

 He left the monkey sitting on the driver's seat.
 The monkey pulled the throttle, locomotive jumped the gun
 And did 90 miles an hour down the mainline run.

 The engineer called up the dispatcher on the phone,
 To tell him all about his locomotive was gone.
 To get on the wire, switch operator to right,
 Cause the monkey's got the mainline sewed up tight.

 Switch operator got the message in time,
 Said there's a Northbound limit on the same main line,
 Open up the switch I'm gonna let him through the hole,
 Cause the monkey's got the locomotive under control.

 Hey, hey, hey the wild wheat waving in the wind.

 Twenty degrees of solitude, twenty degrees in all,
 All the dancing kings and wives assembled in the hall.
 Lost is the long and loneliest town fairly sybil flying.
 All along the, all along the mountains of the moon.

 Hey, Tom Banjo it's time to matter,
 The earth will see you on through this time,
 The earth will see you on through this time.

 Down by the water, the Marsh King's daughter, did you know?
 Clothed in totters always will be.  Tom, where did you go?

 Mountains of the moon, Electra, mountains of the moon,
 All along the, all along the mountains of the moon.

 Hi ho the carrion crow fol de rol de riddle
 Hi ho the carrion crow bow and bend to me.

 They're a band beyond description, like Jehovah's favorite choir.
 People joining hand 'n' hand, while the music plays the band.
 Lord, they're settin' us on fire.

 Crazy rooster crowin' midnight, balls of lightin' roll along.
 Old men sing about their dreams, women laugh and children scream
 And the band keeps playin' on.

 Keep on dancin' thru the daylight, greet the mornin' air with song.
 No one's noticed but the band's all packed and gone.
 Was it ever here at all? But they kept on dancin'.
 C'mon children, c'mon children, come on clap your hands.

 Well the cool breeze came on Tuesday, and the corn's a bumper crop.
 And the fields are full of dancin', full of singin' and romancin'.
 The music never stopped.

 Last leaf fallen bare earth where green was born,
 Black Madonna two eagles hang against a cloud,
 Sun comes up blood red wind yells among the stone,
 All graceful instruments are known.

 When the windows all are broken
 And your love's become a toothless crone,
 When the voices of the storm sound like a crowd,
 Winter morning breaks, you're all alone.

 The eyes are blind, blue visions, all a seer can own,
 And touching makes the flesh to cry out loud
 This ground on which the seed of love is sown,
 All graceful instruments are known.


 New Speedway Boogie  [Garcia/Hunter] (GD1)

 [Intro: E]

 E
 Please don't dominate the rap, Jack,
 If you've got nothing new to say.
 If you please, don't back up the track this train's got to run today.

  E7
 I spent a little time on the mountain,
 E
 Spent a little time on the hill.
 E
 I heard some say, "Better run away,"
  G    D     A
 Others say, "Better stand still."

     E
 Now I don't know, but I been told
  G      D    A
 It's hard to run with the weight of gold.
 E
 Other hand I heard it said,
  GD  A |E . . .| 4x
 It's just as hard with a weight of lead.

 E
 Who can deny, who can deny it's not just a change in style?
 One step done and another begun and I wonder how many miles.

  E7
 I spent a little time on the mountain,
 E
 Spent a little time on the hill.
G    DA
 Things went down we don't understand, but I think in time we will.

     E
 Now I don't know but I was told
 G    D  A
 In the heat of the sun a man died of cold.
 E
 Keep on coming or stand and wait,
     GD  A
 With the sun so dark and the hour so late.

 [Jam on E]

 E
 You can't overlook the lack, Jack, of any other highway to ride.
 It's got no signs or dividing lines, and very few rules to guide.

  E7
 I spent a little time on the mountain,
 E
 Spent a little time on the hill.
      G      D      A
 I saw things getting out of hand, I guess they always will.

     E
 Now I don't know but I been told,
 G    D A
 If the horse don't pull you got to carry the load.
 E
 I don't know whose back's that strong;
 G   D     A
 Maybe find out before too long.

 E
 One way or another, one way or another,
 One way or another, this darkness got to give.




 One More Saturday Night  [Weir] (GDA)

   C7
 I went down to the mountain, I was drinking some wine,
 I looked up into heaven; Lord I saw a mighty sign,
 Writ in fire across the heaven, plain as black and white:
 "Get prepared. There's gonna be a party tonight."

 [Chorus]
F7     C7     G7 F7
 Uh-huh, hey Saturday night.   Yeah, uh-huh, One more Saturday night.
    C7
 Hey, Saturday night.

 Everybody's dancin' down at the local armory,
 With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery.
 Temperature keeps risin'; everybody gittin' high.
 Come the rockin' stroke of midnight, the whole place gonna fly.

 [Chorus]
 [Jam on verse and chorus chords]

 I turn on Channel Six. The President comes on the news.
 Says, "I get no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues."
 His wife says, "Don't get crazy, Lord, you know just what to do,
 Crank up that old Victrola. Put on your rockin' shoes."

 [Chorus]

 Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth,
 Thought He'd have a big old party; thought He'd call it planet earth.
 Don't worry about tomorrow. Lord, you'll know it when it comes,
 When the rockin', rollin' music meets the risin', shinin' sun.

 On The Road Again  [Traditional]

 C
 Why I married a bad girl, tell you the reason why
 Bad girls will even do things on the sly
 Look for your dinner to be good and hot
 She never even put a stew bone in the pot

F
 She's on the road again, sure as you're born
 C
 Natural born easy on the road again
F
 She's on the road again, sure as you're born

 Friend come by, say looking for his hat
 Wants to know where your husband's at
 I don't know, he's on his way to the pen
 Come on pretty mama, let's get on the road again

 [Chorus]
 [Jam]

 Went to my house my front door was locked
 Went 'round to my window, but my window was locked
 Jumped right back, shook my head,
 Big old rounder in my folding bed
 Jumped into the window, broke the glass
 Never seen that little rounder run so fast

 [Chorus x2]


 Operator  [McKernan] (GDA,GD1)

 Operator, can you help me? Help me if you please.
 Bb  F
 Give me the right area code and the number that I need.
      F#   G     C
 My rider left upon the Midnight Flyer
     A7 Dm   C  F
 Singin' like a summer breeze.

 I think she's somewhere down south, down about Baton Rouge.
 But I just can't remember no number, a number I can use.
 Directory don't have it, Central done forgot it;
 Got to find a number to use.

 |F . . .|C . . A |Dm . . C |F . . .|. . . .|

 Trying to check out her number, trying to run down her line.
 Op'rator said that's priv'ledged information
 And it ain't no business of mine.
 It's flooding down in Texas, the poles are out in Utah;
 Gotta find a private line.

 She could be hanging 'round a steel mill,
 Working in a house of blue lights,
 Riding a getaway bus out of Portland, talking to the night.
 I don't know where she's going, I don't care where she's been,
 Long as she's been doin' it right.

 [Jam on verse chords]

 |F . . .|C . . A|Dm    F
    Long as she's been doin' it right.


 Other One  [Weir/Kreutzmann] (GDA)

 Spanish lady comes to me, she lays on me this rose.
 It rainbow spirals round and round it trembles and explodes.
 It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away.
 But the heat came 'round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day.

 Comin', comin', comin' around, comin', around,
 comin', around, in a circle
 Comin', comin', comin' around, comin' around, in a circle,
 Comin', comin', comin' around, comin' in a circle.

 Skippin' through the lily fields I came across an empty space,
 It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in it's place.
 The bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began,
 There was cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to never ever land.

 Comin', comin', comin' around, comin', around,
 comin', around,  in a circle
 Comin', comin', comin' around, comin' around, in a circle,
 Comin', comin', comin' around, comin' in a circle.


 

 Passenger  [Lesh/P.Monk] (GDA)

 Firefly, can you see me?
 Shine on, glowing, brief and brightly
 Could you imagine?  One summer day,
 That same night be on your way

 Do you remember?  Hearts were too cold
 Seasons have frozen us into our souls
 People were sayin' the whole world is burning
 Ashes have scattered too hard to turn

 Upside out or inside down
 False alarm, the only game in town
 No man's land, the only game in town
 Terrible, the only game in town

 Passenger, don't you hear me?
 Destination seen unclearly.
 What is a man deep down inside,
 What a raging beast with nothing to hide.

 Upside out or inside down
 False alarm, the only game in town
 No man's land, the only game in town
 Terrible, the only game in town

 What would your mama think if she heard my guineas clink?
 Saw me marching at the head of my, soldiers-O.

 Come steppin' down the stairs combin' back your yellow hair.
 Bid a last farewell to your, William-O.

 Pride of Cucamonga  [Lesh/Peterson] (GD2)

 Out on the edge of an empty highway,
 Howling at the blood on the moon,
 Big diesel Mack truck rolling down my way,
 Can't hit that border too soon.
 Running hard out of Muskrat Flats, it was sixty days or double life,
 Hail on my back like a shotgun blast, high wind chimes in the night.

 Oh, oh the Pride of Cucamonga, oh, oh bitter olives in the sun,
 Oh, oh I had me some lovin', and I done some time.

 Since I came down from Oregon, there's a lesson or two I've learned
 By standing in the road alone, standing watching the fires burn.
 The northern sky it stinks with greed,
 You can smell it for miles around,
 Good ole boys in the Greystone Hotel, sitting doing that git on down.

 Oh, oh the Pride of Cucamonga, of, of silver apples in the sun,
 Oh, oh I had me some lovin', and I done some time.

 I see your silver shining town, but I know I can't go there --
 Your streets run deep with poisoned wine,
 Your doorways crawl with fear.
 So I think I'll drift for ol' where it's at,
 Where the weed grows green and fine
 And wrap myself around a bush of that bright, whoa, on Oaxaca vine.

 Yes, it's me, I'm the Pride of Cucamonga,
 I can see golden forests in the sun.


 Promised Land  [C.Berry]

 [Intro: a a a a |A . . .|D . . .|]
 [Key change to C]

 C F
 Left my home in Norfolk Virginia, California on my mind.
 G
 Straddled that Greyhound, it rode me past Raleigh,
     C
 And on across Caroline.

 Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill,
 And we never was a minute late.
 We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown,
 Rollin' 'cross the Georgia state.

 Had motor trouble it turned into a struggle, half way 'cross Alabam,
 The 'hound broke down & left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham.

 [Jam]

 Straight off bought me a through train ticket,
 Right across Mississippi clean
 And I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
 Smoking into New Orleans.

 Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
 Just help me get to Houston town.
 People are there who care a little 'bout me
 And they won't let the poor boy down.

 Sure as she bore me, she bought me a silk suit,
 Put luggage in my hands,
 And I woke up high over Albequerque
 On a jet to the promised land.

 [Jam]

 Workin' on a T-bone steak a la carte,
 Flying over to the Golden State;
 When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes
 We'd be headin' in the terminal gate.

 Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
 Taxi to the terminal zone;
 Cut your engines, cool your wings,
 And let me make it to the telephone.

 Los Angeles give me Norfolk Virginia,
 Tidewater four-ten-o-nine
 Tell the folks back home this is the promised land callin'
 And the poor boy's on the line.

 [Jam]



 The Race Is On  [D.Rollins]

 G
 I feel tears welling up from down deep inside,
  C   G
 Like my heart's got a big break.
      A     D
 And a stab of loneliness sharp and painful that I may never shake.

 G
 You might think that I'm taking it hard
    C     G
 Since you broke me off with a call,
    G
 You might wager that I'll hide in sorrow
D   G
 And I might lay right down and bawl.

 [Chorus]
   G
 Now the race is on and here comes pride up the back stretch,
C
 Heartaches a goin' to the inside,
G     AD
 My tears are holding back, tryin' not to fall.

 G
 My heart's out of the running,
    C  G
 True love scratched for another's sake,
      G
 The race is on and it looks like heartaches,
  D     G
 And the winner loses all.

 [Jam]

 One day I ventured in love never once suspecting
 What the final result would be.
 Now I live in fear of waking up each morning,
 And finding that you're gone from me.

 There's an aching pain in my heart
 For the name of the one that I hated to face,
 Someone else came out to win her, and I came out in second place.

 [Chorus]
 [Jam]

 And the race is on and looks like heartaches,

G   C
 If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine
G
 And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung,
    C
 Would you hear my voice come thru the music?
      GD  C   G
 Would you hold it near as it were your own?

 It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken;
 Perhaps they're better left unsung.
 I don't know, don't really care.
 Let there be songs to fill the air.

 [Bridge]
 AmD    G  C
 Ripple in still water, when there is no pebble tossed,
     A7  D
 Nor wind to blow.

 Reach out your hand if your cup be empty,
 If your cup is full may it be again.
 Let it be known there is a fountain
 That was not made by the hands of men.

 There is a road, no simple highway,
 Between the dawn and the dark of night,
 And if you go, no one may follow,
 That path is for your steps alone.

 [Bridge]
 Ripple in still water, when there is no pebble tossed,
 Nor wind to blow.

 You who choose to lead must follow,
 But if you fall, you fall alone.
 If you should stand, then who's to guide you?
 If I knew the way I would take you home.

 La dee da da da, la da da da da, da da da da, da da, da da da da da.
 La da da da, la da da da da, la da da da, la da da da da.

 Samson and Delilah  [Traditional]

 [Intro: G C G D G]

 G    F   F# G  C  G7   C C#G7
 If I had my way, I would tear this old building down.

      G
 Well Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair,
 D   G
 She had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair.
 G
 Delilah she gained old Samson's mind.
     D    G
 When first he saw this woman, it could be the last time.
 G
 Delilah she sat down on Samson's knee,
     DG
 Said, "Tell me where your strength lies if you please."
     G
 She spoke so kind, God knows, she talked so fair,
    C      G
 Samson said, "Delilah, you cut off my hair.
  G
 You can shave my head, clean as my hand
 CG
 And my strength will become as natural as any old man.

 G    F   F# G  C      G  F   F# G   F C
 If I had my way, if I had my way, if I had my way,
  G7   C C#G7
 I would tear this old building down."

 You read about Samson, all from his works,
 He was the strongest man that ever had lived on earth.
 One day when Samson was walking along,
 Looked down on the ground, he saw an old jawbone.

 He stretched out his arm, God knows, chains broke like thread,
 When he got to moving, ten thousand was dead.

 If I had my way, if I had my way, if I had my way,
 I would tear this old building down.

 [Jam on intro]

 Now Samson and the lion, they got in a tack,
 Samson he crawled up on the lion's back.
 You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws,
 But Samson got his hands up around that lion's jaws.

 And he ripped that beast, God knows he killed him dead.
 And the bees made honey in the lion's head.

 If I had my way, if I had my way, if I had my way,
 I would tear this old building down.


 
 Scarlet Begonias  [Garcia/Hunter] (GDA,GD2)

 [Intro: |B . . .|. . E .|B . . .|. . A .|]

    E  B
 As I was walkin' 'round Grosvenor Square,
E B
 Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air.
A   E  B     A    E
 From the other direction, she was calling my eye;
A    E B    A     E    B
 It could be an illusion, but I might as well try, might as well try.

 She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes,
 And I knew without askin' she was into the blues.
 She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls;
 I knew right away she was not like other girls, other girls.

 In the heat of the evening when the dealing got rough,
 She was too pat to open and too cool to bluff.
 As I picked up my matches and was closing the door,
 I had one of those flashes I'd been there before, been there before.

 [Bridge]
  F#
 Well, I ain't often right but I've never been wrong;
 B      A    E
 Seldom turns out the way it does in the song.
 F#
 Once in a while you get shown the light
 B      A  |E . . .|. . . .|
 In the strangest of places, if you look at it right.

 |F# . . .|. . . .|A . . .|. . . .|B . . .|. . . .|. . . .|. . . .|

 Well there ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves,
 Or scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues.
 And there's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eye;
 I had to learn the hard way to let her pass by, let her pass by.

 [Jam on verse chords]

 The wind in the willow's playin' "Tea for Two";
 The sky was yellow and the sun was blue.
 Strangers stoppin' strangers just to shake their hand;
 Everybody is playing in the heart of gold band, heart of gold band.

 It's not because you missed out on the thing that we had to start.
 Maybe you had too much too fast (maybe you had too much too fast).

 Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart (Don't tell me this...)

 Ship of Fools  [Garcia/Hunter] (GDA,GD2)

 Went to see the captain, strangest I could find,
 Laid my proposition down, laid it on the line.
 I won't slave for beggar's pay, likewise gold and jewels,
 But I would slave to learn the way to sink your ship of fools.

 Ship of fools on a cruel sea, ship of fools sail away from me.
 It was later than I thought when I first believed you,
 Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools.

 Saw your first ship sink and drown, from rockin' of the boat,
 And all that could not sink or swim was just left there to float.
 I won't leave you drifting down, but woh it makes me wild,
 With thirty years upon my head to have you call me child.

 Ship of fools on a cruel sea, ship of fools sail away from me.
 It was later than I thought when I first believed you,
 Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools.

 The bottles stand as empty, as they were filled before.
 Time there was and plenty, but from that cup no more.
 Though I could not caution all, I still might warn a few:
 Don't lend your hand to raise no flag atop no ship of fools.

 Ship of fools on a cruel sea, ship of fools sail away from me.
 It was later than I thought, when I first believed you,
 Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools.

 It was later than I thought when I first believed you,
 Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools.

 Down every lonely street that's ever been
 Stella blue. Stella blue.

 Dust off those rusty strings just one more time,

 Gonna make them shine (shine).

 It all rolls into one and nothing comes for free,
 There's nothing you can hold, for very long.
 And when you hear that song come crying like the wind,
 It seems like all this life was just a dream.
 Stella Blue. Stella Blue.

 Got to help me, girl, now
 Could it be infatuation or am I just being misled now?

 Little bolt of inspiration Way you strike me now
 Sparking my imagination, got the lightning now
 Cause me such excitation, got the lightning now
 'Bout to end my suffocation, come on strike me now
 Little bolt of inspiration
 Way you strike me now, she's back in my imagination

 Terrapin Station - Lady With a Fan  [Garcia/Hunter] (GDA)

 [Intro: F]

 G    Dm     C  GF
 Let my inspiration flow in token rhyme, suggesting rhythm,
    C   F  C    F C Am9 Dm9
 That will not forsake you, till my tale is told and done.
 G Dm
 While the firelight's aglow,
  C     G F
 Strange shadows from the flames will grow,
    C  F
 Till things we've never seen will seem familiar.

 Shadows of a sailor, forming winds both foul and fair, all swarm.
 Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady many years ago.
 Here beside him stands a man, a soldier from the looks of him,
 Who came through many fights, but lost at love.

 While the storyteller speaks, a door within the fire creaks;
 Suddenly flies open, and a girl is standing there.
 Eyes alight, with glowing hair, all that fancy paints as fair,
 She takes her fan and throws it, in the lion's den.

 Which of you to gain me, tell, will risk uncertain pains of hell?
 I will not forgive you if you will not take the chance.
 The sailor gave at least a try; the soldier being much too wise,
 Strategy was his strength, and not disaster.

 The sailor, coming out again, the lady fairly leapt at him.
 That's how it stands today. You decide if he was wise.
 The story teller makes no choice. Soon you will not hear his voice.
 His job is to share the light, and not to master.

 |F . . .| 6x  F B Em C7

 Fmaj7      C9
 Since the end is never told, we paid the teller off in gold,
    Fmaj7  E
 In hopes he will come back, but he cannot be bought or sold.

 He could pass his time, around some other line
 But you know he chose this place beside her.
 Don't get in the way, there's nothing you can say,
 Nothing that you need to add or do.

 They love each other. Lord you can see that it's true.
 Lord you can see that it's true. Lord you can see that it's true.

 [Jam]

 It's nothing, they explain, it's like a diesel train.
 You better not be there when it rolls over.
 And when that train rolls in, you wonder where it's been.
 You gotta try to see a little further.

 They love each other. Lord you can see that it's true.
 Lord you can see that it's true. Lord you can see that it's true.
 Lord you can see that it's true. Lord you can see that it's true.
 Lord you can see that it's true.

 Though you'll make a noise, just can't hear your voice.
 All the dizzy ride on your cold shoulder.

 Won't you believe what I say is true?
 Everything I did I heard it first from you.
 (Everything I tell you, I heard it first from you.)

 Heard your news report, you know you're falling short.
 Pretty soon, we'll trust you for the weather.
 When that ship comes in, you won't know where it's been.
 You got to try to see a little further.


 
 Throwing Stones  [Weir/Barlow]

 [Intro: A Asus4 ]

      Bm     A     E    A
 Picture a bright blue ball just spinning, spinning free,
      Bm      G     A
 Dizzy with eternity.
      Em      A    Em
 Painted with a skin of sky, brush in some clouds and sea.
  Bm    A
 Call it home for you and me.

      Bm    A   E     A
 A peaceful place or so it looks from space
      Bm  G      A
 A closer look reveals the human race.
      Em A  Em
 Full of hope, full of grace, is the human face.
      Bm   A
 But afraid, we may our home to waste.

    E      D     A    E D A
 There's a fear down here we can't forget,
 EDA    E D A  E D     A     E D A
 Hasn't got a name just yet. Always awake, always around.
  E D     A
 Singing ashes, ashes all fall down. Ashes, ashes all fall down.

 Now watch as the ball revolves as the nighttime falls.
 And again the hunt begins and again the blood wind calls.
 By and by again, the morning sun will rise.
 But the darkness never goes from some men's eyes. (Well I know)

 It strolls the sidewalks and it rolls the streets.
 Staking turf, dividing up meat.
 Nightmare spook, piece of heat; you and me, you and me.

 Click flash blade in ghetto night. Rudies looking for a fight.
 Rat cat alley, roll them bones. Need that cash to feed that jones,
 And the politicians throwing stones.
 Singing ashes, ashes all fall down. Ashes, ashes all fall down.

     C#m A   E
 Commissars and pin-stripe bosses roll the dice.
      BmAE      A
 Any way they fall guess who gets to pay the price.
E    A E      D A
 Money green or proletarian gray, selling guns instead of food today.

 ED    A
 So the kids they dance, they shake their bones
  E    D    A
 And the politicians throwing stones.
 E  D     A
 Singing ashes, ashes all fall down. Ashes, ashes all fall down.

      Bm   AE      A
 Heartless powers try to tell us what to think.
      Bm   G A
 If the spirit's sleeping, then the flesh is ink. (Yeah)
      Em   A  Em
 History's page, will be neatly carved in stone.
     Bm   A
 The future's here, we are it, we are on our own. (On our own...)

 |A . . . |D . A . |A . . . |E . A . |  <-- 6 times
|Bm . A . |E . . . |A . . . |D . A . |  <-- 2 times

     C#m  A E
 If the game is lost then we're all the same.
      Bm     Bm A Em     A
 No one left to place or take the blame.
E     AE
 We will leave this place an empty stone.
  F#m      D    A
 Or this shining ball of blue we can call our home.

 So the kids they dance, they shake their bones
 While the politicians are throwing stones
 Singing ashes, ashes all fall down.
 Ashes, ashes all fall down. (E D A <-- 4 times)

 Shipping powders back and forth.
 Singing "Black goes south while white comes north."
 And the whole world full of petty wars.
 Singing "I got mine and you got yours."
 While the current fashions set the pace,
 Lose your step, fall out of grace.
 The radical he rant and rage,
 Singing "Someone got to turn the page."
 And the rich man in his summer home,
 Singing "Just leave well enough alone."
 But his pants are down, his cover's blown.
 And the politicians throwing stones.
 So the kids they dance they shake their bones.
 'Cause it's all too clear we're on our own.
 Singing ashes, ashes all fall down. Ashes, ashes all fall down.
      Bm   AE    A
 Picture a bright blue ball just spinning, spinning free.
      Bm      G    A
 It's dizzying, the possibilities. Ashes, Ashes all fall down.


 Till The Morning Comes  [Garcia/Hunter] (GD1)

 [Intro: |E . D . |A . . .|E . D .|A . . .|E . D .|A . . .|E . D .| ]

AE G DA
 Till the morning comes,    it'll do you fine.
 E G D  A
 Till the morning comes,    like a highway sign.
   E D
 Showing you the way, leaving no doubt
 AE D A
 Of the way on in or the way back out.

 [Bridge]
 E7+9  A7 E7+9   A7
 Tell you what I'll do; I'll watch out for you.
 E7+9      B7      E7 A7C#   D     Dm
 You're my woman now, make yourself easy, make yourself easy,
 Am E
 Make yourself easy.

 Till we all fall down, it'll do you fine.
 Don't think about what you left behind.
 The way you came or the way you go.
 Let your tracks be lost in the dark and snow.

 [Bridge]

 When the shadows grow, it'll do you fine.
 When the cold winds blow it'll ease your mind.
 The shape it takes could be yours to choose,
 What you may win, what you may lose.

 [Bridge]

 Bm AE
 You're my woman now (make yourself easy). [Repeat]

 Touch of Grey  [Garcia/Hunter]

 Must be getting early, clocks are running late.
 Paint-by-number morning sky, looks so phony.
 Dawn is breaking everywhere, light a candle, curse the glare
 Draw the curtains I don't care, but it's alright
 I will get by, I will get by, I will get by, I will survive.

 I see you've got your list out, say your piece and get out.
 Guess I get the jist of it, but it's alright
 Sorry that you feel that way, the only thing I have to say
 Every silver linings got a touch of grey
 I will get by, I will get by, I will get by, I will survive.

 It's a lesson to me, the ables and the bakers and the theives
 The abc's we all think of, try to keep a little love.

 I know the rent is in arrears, the dog has not been fed in years
 It's even worse than it appears, but it's alright

 Cow is giving kerosene, kid can't read at seventeen
 The words he knows are all obscene, but it's alright
 I will get by, I will get by, I will get by, I will survive.

 Shoe is on the hand it fits, that's all there really is to it
 Whistle through your teeth and spit, but it's alright

 Oh well a touch of grey, kinda suits you anyway,
 That's all I had to say, but it's alright
 I will get by, I will get by, I will get by, I will survive.

 It's a lesson to me, the deltas and the East and the freeze
 The abc's we all must face, try to save a little grace.


 
 Truckin  [Garcia/Weir/Hunter/Lesh] (GDA,GD1)

 E  A
 Truckin' got my chips cashed in, keep truckin' like the doo-dah man.
   B  Bsus4 A      E
 Together, more or less in line, just keep truckin' on.

 E
 Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street.
 Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street.
 Your typical city involved in a typical daydream,
 Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings.

 Dallas got a soft machine, Houston too close to New Orleans,
 New York got the ways and means, but just won't let you be.

 Most of the cats that you meet on the street speak of true love.
 Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home.
 One of these days they know they gotta get goin'
 Out of the door and down to the street all alone.

 Truckin' like the doo-dah man
 Once told me "You got to play your hand.
 Sometimes the cards ain't worth a dime, if you don't lay 'em down."

 [Bridge]
 A   G D A
 Sometimes the lights all shinin' on me,
 A   D      A   G D A
 Other times I can barely see.
 D    BF#  A  E
 Lately it occurs to me. What a long, strange trip it's been.

 What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
 She lost her sparkle; you know she isn't the same.
 Livin' on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine,
 All a friend can say is, "Ain't it a shame."

 Truckin' up to Buffalo, been thinkin' you got to mellow slow.
 Takes time, you pick a place to go, just keep truckin' on.

 Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window,
 Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again.
 I'd like to get some sleep before I travel,
 But if you got a warrant I guess you're gonna come in.

 Busted down on Bourbon Street. Set up like a bowlin' pin.
 Knocked down, it get's to wearin' thin, they just won't let you be.

 You're sick of hangin' around, and you'd like to travel.
 Get tired of travelin', you want to settle down.
 I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin',
 Get out of the door, light out and look all around. E F F# G G#

 [Bridge]

 Truckin', I'm a goin' home, whoa, whoa, baby, back where I belong.
 Back home, sit down and patch my bones and get back truckin' on.
 Get back truckin' on. [repeat/adlib]

 [Jam on E]

 [Intro: E/e g# b  A/a c# e]

 Without a warning you stole my heart, takin' it baby, tore it apart
E   A      E A
 And you left me standin' in the corner cryin'
E   A     E     A
 Told me your love, was slowly dyin'

 So I'm begging you babe, baby, please.
 Begging you babe, I'm on my knees.
 Turn on your light, let it shine on me.
 Turn on your lovelight, let it shine on me.
 Let it shine, let it shine, let it

 When I get a little lonely in the middle of the night
 And I need you darlin' to make things alright
 So come on babe, baby please,
 And I'm beggin' you baby, I'm on my knees.
 Turn on your light, let it shine on me.
 Turn on your lovelight, let it shine on me
 A little bit higher, a little bit higher,
 Turn on your light, a little bit higher,
 And let it shine, let it shine, let it

 [Jam]

 Without a warning you stole my heart, takin' it baby, tore it apart
 And you left me standin' in the corner cryin'
 Told me your love, was slowly dyin'

 So I'm begging you babe, baby, please.
 Begging you babe, I'm on my knees.
 Turn on your light, let it shine on me.
 Turn on your lovelight, let it shine on me.
 Just a little bit higher, a little bit higher,

 Unbroken Chain  [Lesh/Peterson] (GD2)

 Blue light rain, whoa unbroken chain,
 Looking for familiar faces in an empty window pane.

 Listening for the secret, searching for the sound
 But I could only hear the preacher and the baying of his hounds.

 Willow sky, whoa, I walk and wonder why,
 They say love your brother, but you will catch it when you try.

 Roll you down the line boy, drop you for a loss,
 Ride you out on a cold railroad and nail you to a cross.

 November and more, as I wait for the score,
 They're telling me forgiveness is the key to every door.
 A slow winder day a night like forever,
 Sink like a stone, float like a feather.

 (instrumental)
 Lilac rain, unbroken chain, Song of the sawhet owl.
 Out on the mountain, it'll drive you insane,
 Listening to the winds howl

 Unbroken chain of sorrow and pearls, Unbroken chain of shy and sea.
 Unbroken chain of the western wind, Unbroken chain of you and me.

 U.S. Blues  [Garcia/Hunter] (GDA,GD2)

 Red and white, blue suede shoes, I'm Uncle Sam, how do you do?
 Gimme five, I'm still alive, ain't no luck, I learned to duck.
 Check my pulse, it don't change.
 Stay seventy-two come shine or rain.
 Wave the flag, pop the bag, rock the boat, skin the goat.
 Wave that flag, wave it wide and high.
 Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my.

 I'm Uncle Sam, that's who I am;
 Been hidin' out in a rock and roll band.
 Shake the hand that shook the hand of P.T. Barnum and Charlie Chan.
 Shine your shoes, light your fuse.  Can you use them ol' U.S. Blues?
 I'll drink your health, share your wealth,
 Run your life, steal your wife.
 Wave that flag, wave it wide and high.
 Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my.

 Back to back chicken shack.  Son of a gun, better change your act.
 We're all confused, what's to lose?
 You can call this all the United States Blues.
 Wave that flag, wave it wide and high.
 Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my.



 Wave That Flag  [Garcia/Hunter]

 Wave that flag, pop the bag, skin the goat, learn to cope
 Bell the rat, trap the cat, ball the jack, chew the fat
 Read the signs, connect the lines, pay your fines, save your dimes
 Pick up time, light the fuse, making time, pass the juice

 Eat at days, hide in caves, pull the tooth, stretch the truth
 Feed the poor, starve the war, pick up chicks, catch the fix
 Get your kicks, pick up sticks, trim your wick, take your pick
 Try your tricks, impress the chicks

 Wash the fence, dig the den, live the vain, die in shame
 Catch the fool, burn the stew, shine your shoes, sing the blues

 Wave the flag, pop the bag, bell the cat, trap the rat
 Ball the jack, chew the fat, shoot the breeze, lose the keys
 Read the signs, connect the lines, pay your fines, read the rhyme
 Shhot the breeze, lose your keys, don't be late, what I say

 Walk on waves, read the raves, eat at day, hide in caves
 Stretch the truth, pull the tooth, feed the poor, starve the war
 Cash the fix, get your kicks, trim your wick, take your pick
 Try your tricks, impress the chicks

 Wash the fence, dig the den, live the shame,die in vain
 Catch the fool, burn the stew, shine your shoes, sing the blues

 Circle songs and sands of time,
 And seasons will end in tumbled rhyme,

 Flowing, flowing 'til the rivers all are dry;
 Growing, the lovin' in her eyes.

 West L.A. Fadeaway  [Garcia/Hunter]

 I'm looking for a chateau, 21 rooms but one will do
 I'm looking for a chateau, 21 rooms but one will do
 I don't want to buy it
 I just want to rent it for a minute or two

 I met an old mistake walking down the street today
 I met an old mistake walking down the street today
 I didn't want to be mean about it
 I couldn't think of one good thing to say.

 West L.A. fadeaway, West L.A. fadeaway
 Big red lite on the highway, little green lite on the freeway.

 Got a steady job moving items for the mob
 Got a steady job moving items for the mob
 Know the pay's pathetic
 It's a shame those boys couldn't be more copasetic

 West L.A. fadeaway, West L.A. fadeaway
 Big red lite on the highway, little green lite on the freeway.

 I need a West L.A. girl, already know what I need to know
 I need a West L.A. girl, already know what I need to know
 A name, address and a phone number,
 Lord, just how far to go.

 West L.A. fadeaway, here's one chance you say.
 She tries to live by the Golden Rule.
 Said you treat other people right,
 Other people probably treat you cool.

 Blind and dirty, asked me for a dime, a dime for a cup of coffee.

 I got no dime but I got some time to hear his story.

 My name is August West, and I love my Pearly Baker best
 More than my wine.
 More than my wine, more than my maker, though he's no friend of mine.

 Everyone said, I'd come to no good,
 I knew I would Pearly, believe them.
 Half of my life, I spent doin' time for some other fucker's crime.
 The other half found me stumblin' around drunk on Burgundy wine. D A

 "Pearly's been true, true to me, true to my dyin' day," he said,
 I said to him, I said to him, "I'm sure she's been."
 I said to him, "I'm sure she's been true to you."

 [Jam on A]

 Got up and wandered, wandered downtown.
 Nowhere to go but just to hang around.
 I've got a girl, named Benny Lee.
 I know that girl's been true to me.
 I know she's been, I'm sure she's been true to me.

 What's Become of the Baby  [Garcia/Hunter]

 Waves of violet go crashing and laughing
 The rainbow winged singing birds fly 'round the sun
 Sun bells rain down in a liquid profusion
 Mermaids on porpoises draw up the dawn
 What's become of the baby this cold December morning?

 Songbirds frozen in their flight
 Drifting to the earth, remnants of forgotten dreaming
 Dawning answer comes there none.

 Go to sleep you child, dream of never-ending always
 Panes of crystal ice sparkle like waterfalls
 Lighting the polished ice caverns of the dawn,
 But where in the looking-glass fields of illusion
 Wandered the child who was perfect as the dawn?
 What's become of the baby this cold December morning?
 What's become of the baby this cold December morning?

 Racing in rhythm of the sun
 All the world revolves captured in the eye of woman
 Allah, where are you now?

 All eyes are blinded by the sparkling waters
 Scheherazade gethering stories to tell
 From primal gold fantasy petals that fold,
 But where is the child who played with the sunshines?
 And chased the cloud shape to the regions of mind?
 Standing stream cries the south wind
 Lost in the regions of
 Shadow-like chains of illusion, delusions of living and dead.

 Every time that wheel turn 'round,
 C
 Bound to cover just a little more ground.
 [tacet]
 Bound to cover just a little more ground.

 [Chorus]

 Won't you try just a little bit harder,
 Couldn't you try just a little bit more?
 Won't you try just a little bit harder,
 Couldn't you try just a little bit more?

 [Jam on C]
