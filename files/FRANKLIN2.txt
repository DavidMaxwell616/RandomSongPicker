Subject: Franklin's Tower...From Bill

This is how I learned "Franklin's Tower" by the Dead.  I don't know if the
chords are right because a friend of mine showed me how to play it.  In any
case, here it is:

Artist:Greatful Dead
Song: "Franklin's Tower"
Album :Blues For Allah
Written By:Robert Hunter (Words); Jerry Garcia and Bill Kreutzmann (Music)

A: 002220     G:320033     D: 000323

A                G    D           G A                G           D            G
In another time's forgotten space,   your eyes looked from your mother's face
A               G        D             G A         G                    D         G   
Wild flower seed on the sand and stone,   may the four winds blow you safely home
A        G     D  G     
Roll away the dew.  
A        G     D  G     
Roll away the dew.  
A        G     D  G     
Roll away the dew.  
A        G     D  G     
Roll away the dew.

I'll tell you where the four winds dwell, in Franklin's Tower there hangs a bell
It can ring, turn night to day, it can ring like fire when you lose your way

Chorus

God save the child who rings the bell, it may have one good ring; baby, you can't tell
One watch by night, one watch by day, if you get confused, listen to the music play

Chorus

Some come to laugh thier past away, some come to make it one more day
Whichever way your pleasure tends, if you plant ice, you're gonna harvest wind

Chorus

In Franklin's Tower the four winds sleep, like four lean hounds the lighthouse keep
Wild flower seed in the sand and wind, may the four winds blow you home again

Chorus

This song could be dead solid perfect or totally wrong, I don't know.
However, this is how I learned it and this is how I play it.  If it is
totally wrong, at least the words are here.  That is all!

No Worries!
