CABARET
 (J. Kander / Bob Thiele)
C               
 What good is sittin' alone in your room
                     G
 Come hear the music play, yes
 F         F#dim C      A    
 Life is a cabaret old chum
 D7           G7  C
 Come to the cabaret

 Put down that knittin', the book and the broom
 Time for a holiday, yes
 Life is a cabaret old chum
 So come to the cabaret

 Come taste the wine, come hear that band
 Yes, it's time for celebratin'
 Right this way, your table's waitin'

 No use permittin' a prophet of doom
 Wipe every smile away, yes
 Life is a cabaret old chum
 So come to the cabaret, yes

 ------ instrumental break ------

 Yes, life is a cabaret old chum
 Only a cabaret old chum
 So come to the cabaret
