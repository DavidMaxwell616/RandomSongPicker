Rainy Day, Dream Away

(De de de de)
(Are we rolling yet, are we rollin yet?)
Cough, cough, sniff, sniff
(Here we can see your ass landing, twist you up inside)

Hey man, take a look out the window an' see what's happening
Hey man, it's rainin'
It's rainin' outside, man
Oh, don't worry about that, brother
Everything's gonna be everything
We'll get into something real nice, you know
Why don't ya sit back and groove on a rainy day

Sniff, yeah
SNIFF
Yeah, I see what you mean, brother
Maybe I can groove

Rainy day
Dream away
Let the sun take a holiday
Flowers bathe, and, uh,
see the children play
Lay back and groove on a rainy day
Well I can see a bunch of wet preachers,
look at 'em on the run
The carnival traffic noise, it sinks
into the splashy hum
Even the ducks can groove
rain burdened in a park-side pool
And I'm leanin' out my window sill
diggin' everything
And, uh, you too

Rainy day
Rain all day
Ain't no use in gettin' up tight
Just let it groove its own way
Let it drain
your worries away
Lay back and groove on a rainy day
Lay back and dream on a rainy day
