In the moonlight, in the midnight, in the moonlight, midnight moonlight. (2)

If you ever feel sorrow for the deeds you have done,
With no hope for tomorrow in the setting of the sun.
And the ocean is howling of things that might have been,
And that last good morning sunrise will be the brightest you've ever seen.

In the moonlight, in the midnight, in the moonlight, midnight moonlight.

C          A

If you ever feel sorrow for the deeds you have done,
With no hope for tomorrow in the setting of the sun.
And the ocean is howling of things that might have been,
And that last good morning sunrise will be the brightest you've ever seen.

In the moonlight, in the midnight, in the moonlight, midnight moonlight.
