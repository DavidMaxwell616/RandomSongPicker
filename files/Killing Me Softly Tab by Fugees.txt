 Em                       Am        D7                       G                                                                                                                         
Strumming my pain with my fingers.  singing my life with his words.
 Em                      A                     D              C
Killing me softly with his song.  Killing me softly with his song.
           G               C
Telling my whole life with his words.
            Esus4             E
Killing me softly,  with his song.      
                                     
Am7            D                     
    I heard he sang the good song.   
G              C                     
    I heard he had a style.          
Am7           D                      
    And so I came to see him,        
        Em                           
    and listen for a while.          
Am7              D7                  
    And there he was a young boy     
G             B7
   a stranger to my eyes.

    (CHORUS)

I felt all flushed with fever 
embarrassed by the crowd.
I felt he found my letters 
and read each one out loud.
I prayed that he would finish
but he just kept right on.

    (CHORUS)

He sang as if knew me 
in all my dark despair.
And then he looked right through me
as if I wasn't there.
And he just kept on singing 
sining clear and strong

    (CHORUS)

harmony....
