Silly Love Songs
(Paul McCartney)


C  Em7  Fmaj7


You'd think that people would have
had enough of silly love songs.
But I look around me and I see it isn't so
Some people wanna fill the world
with silly love songs,
and what's wrong with that?
I'd like to know
'Cause here I go again.

I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.

I can't explain; the feeling's plain to me.
Say, can't you see?
Ah, she gave me more, she gave it all to me;
Now can't you see,
What's wrong with that?
I need to know,
'Cause here I go again.

I love you.
I love you.
Love doesn't come n a minute
Sometimes it doesn t come at all.
I only know that when I'm in it,
It isn't silly
No it isn't silly,
Love isn't silly at all.

How can I tell you about my loved one?
How can I tell you ~bout my loved one?

I love you .
I love you .
I love you .
I love you .

You'd think that people would have
had enough of silly love songs
But I look around me and I see it isn't so, oh, no.
Some people wann~ fill the world
with silly love songs.
