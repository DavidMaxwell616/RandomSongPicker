couple songs for them (including MMMbop).

SECTION B: MUSIC

1. Where can I get "Golden Feelings" or "A Western Harvest Field by
Moonlight"?

"Golden Feelings" was put out by Sonic Enemy, which went defunct last year. Your best bet is to tape this off
someone you know. "A Western Harvest Field By Moonlight" was put out by Fingerpaint Records, it is currently
out of print, and looks like it will stay that way. You could try some local record stores and ask around, or just get
a dub from someone. 

2. What is "Fresh Meat + Old Slabs"?
"Fresh Meat + Old Slabs" is a tape of old Beck material that he recorded in 1993 for his mom's birthday. It
includes early versions of 'Loser', 'Fume', 'Satan Gave Me a Taco', 'Tasergun', 'Steve Threw Up'..
It is not considered an official release, but more of a bootleg, there are a number of copies and dubs floating
around. 

3. What is "The Banjo Story"?

"The Banjo Story" is a very old homemade tape that Beck did when he was around the age of 18. It includes very
early versions of "Let's Go Moon Some Cars" and "Goin' Nowhere Fast". 

4. What are those things on Beck's album covers?
The cover of Mellow Gold is "The Last Man after the Nuclear War" a sculpture that was constructed by Eddie,
the long haired fellow who can be seen in "Loser" and "Where It's At" videos, and frequently in the kool ass band,
Sukia. This construct is supposedly a nitrous inhaler. 

The cover of Odelay is actually a dog jumping over a hurdle, from the book The Complete Dog Book put out by
the AKC, or American Kennel Club. It's on page 57, and the dog is a Komondor, a sheep dog of Tibetan
descent. 

The odd looking man on the cover of Steve Threw Up is Heino. Heino is a German folk singer who was
enormously popular in the 1960s. He frequently appeared on album covers decked out in turtle necks and vinyl
jackets. The thing which is so interesting about him, is his voice, it is deeper and more powerful than any death
metal singer could hope their voice to be. With this almighty voice, Heino sometimes sings children's lullabies,
which must scare the pants off any 5 year old. 

silva@ridgecrest.ca.us writes:
The cover for Stereopathetic Soulmanure is actually taken from the cover of a record called "Brahms, Gigi,
And All That" by the Clayton Valley Singers. I was just digging through the record section of the local thrift shop
and found it. The cover to the booklet only takes a corner from the record cover.

5. What does Odelay mean?
Odelay is really "órale" a spanish slang term for Right On! The original title for Lord Only Knows was in fact,
órale, but the engineer wrote it down wrong as "odelay." Turned out, Beck dug it and chose it for the album title. 

6. Who has covered Beck?
  Bruce Springsteen supposedly covered Beck at some shows of his.. 
  Mary Lou Lord used to cover Pay No Mind a couple years back.. 
  "Weird" Al Yanchovic did a semi-cover of Loser for his new album Bad Hair Day, the cover can be found in
the track "Alternative Polka". 
  Johnny Cash covered Rowboat on his new album. 
  Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers did Asshole for the soundtrack to "She's the One." 
  Apparently Blues Traveler has covered Loser as well... 
  The Ska-Core Allstars do a cover of "Loser" on their "SKAndalous" album 

7. Is there a story behind "Fume"?
Yes. The true story about Fume is that Beck read an article about these kids who actually got a can of nitrous ,
rolled the windows up, pulled off the road, cranked the radio, and suffocated to death. So he wrote a song about
it. 

8. Who has collaborated with Beck?
Calvin Johnson of Beat Happening, K Records fame, Chris Ballew, of the Presidents of the United States of
America, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion and Mike D of the Beastie Boys, that dog, the Dust Brothers, Emmylou
Harris, Willie Nelson, and Sean "Puffy" Combs. 

9. Whatever happened to the Beck/Puff Daddy collaboration?
well it looks like Puff Daddy just didn't like the outcome, so nothing ever came of it. 

10. What is the "anti-folk" movement?
When Beck took a Greyhound to New York in his early twenties, he got involved in the anti-folk movement,
which was a bunch of punk-influenced songwriters who opposed to the folk establishment. Other artists include
Paleface, Michelle Shocked, and Cindy Lee Berryhill. For more info check out this website:
http://www.pathfinder.com/altculture/aentries/a/antixfolk.html 

11. I heard there was an ultra-rare 12" of Loser that had a different version of the song on it, what is
this?
back in the golden days of the beck internet mystique, mike paige apparently spread the word on his discography
(either on his discography, or by word of mouth, i'm not sure which) that there was ANOTHER Loser 12" that
was played on the KCRW session #1 (1993). 

this is wrong. they didn't play a 12". Beck sang the lyrics over music-from-tape, just like he did with "MTV makes
me wanna smoke crack' later in the show. 

Tom Rothrock of Bong Load Records (who also co-produced the track) says theres only one version as well.
