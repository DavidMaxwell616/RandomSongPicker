No Santa For Esther

Capo 3rd fret

A                           Adim
Colin woke up on a bleary December morn
    A7                             Dm
His Ruger license renewed and his eyes filled with scorn
       G                       Gm        D7              A
The chance that the two would meet in a bar or on the street
     F                 G         A
or perhaps on the compensation board

 Em                        Em7
Then Black Talon Tuesday came
                 A                     C
and they both boarded the Hicksville train
      G                F#dim
and when their paths connected
Dm                           Am
Adelphi's Jamaican upstart selected
     F                  G         A
to greet her with his Turner City 9

Once Audrey Warren smoked his spliff
and his job at Ademco the taxpayers' gift
but the portly Rasta fell off his stool
turning embarrassment into a racial hatred pool

In the Talon Tuesday rain
Esther's first Christmas present came
Not a walkman or a Bel Biv De Voe CDD
Nor a card from daughter Ashlea
Just a slug from a disgruntled Kingston man

When Esther met Colin's eyes that day
Her purse raised to shield her from the spray
Too much of Audrey did she resemble
And as his burnt sienna fingers did tremble
He became distracted and tackled, apprehended and tackled
Esther lived through it but alseep Christmas morn
Not Santa will she see but eyes of scorn
