Subject: Knockin' on Heaven's Door (Plus some)

We always use this tune as a cool jam tune on stage. 
A slow melodic solo in Em pentatonic can really get the crowd
into it. We also use it for guest vocalists, if we can't find
any other song to do together.
The problem has been that the tune is too short...with only two
lyrics. So I've added two more lyrics to finish it off a little
better.
The tune was originally from a movie and is sung while the sheriff
lay dying. So picture the good guy with his white hat on the dusty
ground in his final moments of life...reflecting on the life he 
knew.
The two extra verses are phrased exactly like the previous two.
Forget about other versions of the tune you've heard...make it
your own version...with your own style and flare.
