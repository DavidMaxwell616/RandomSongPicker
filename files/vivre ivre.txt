I'll punch a guy harder than a snooze button
but I wouldn't hit a girl for the world.
So many guys hooked on their quantities so eager
to receive and reluctant to give. 

We hear the woes of neglected bros sinking into swamps 
of all self imported growth. So important to remember 
that nobody is competent of such to survive extremity's 
bliss.

We squander and squabble attempt to endure. 
Our fans are buying it but we're not so sure.
We exist to survive all endurances of past as the
endless chances, romances and dances drinks of fancy
fulfill our blast.

Diseases float to warn the past of what to fear while
the aimless naked jungle brethren pound the floor
and jeer. Claude the William is the field of vision
truth. Railroad train is taking the grain and leaving
us vermouth. 

The girls bring us X but the pleasures
that follow are the tortures of indifference and self
indulgence we borrow. We find when separated no one
can be leader while the eater feeds and needs
the deeds of the greedy meter reader. 

Smash bang whatcha doing girl gal you know why
to grovel while you shovel is dilation of the eye.
Once established all the fundamentals of all my girls
are worth twice their parentals.

Woman golden all their values are eternal. No man's 
integrity could stand immobile to the power of the funnel.
