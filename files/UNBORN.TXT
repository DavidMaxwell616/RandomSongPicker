UNBORN CHILDREN
Erich Kuersten
 
F#                               D
My unborn children sing songs of war
F#                            D
Baby faced black angels at my door
E            G                  D  
Open up your cells and see them crawl across your floor
E              G               D
their eyes are wide hungry for more

A         C                D
My unborn children sing to me 
A        F            G
wordless echoes in my sleep
E             C           D
when I try to rest I only dream 
F    G              D        
as I hear my unborn children scream


I won't use abortion as a tool
as birth control or anything new
its just I'm too possessive to let my children loose
If I mess them up then I shall lose


D                Dmaj7                                 
they're angry at the condoms that
D7                                    G     Gm   
keep them all seperate from what they want 
                               D  
and what would make them whole again
D                
They're just gonna have to wait
E
angry at what'll be their fate
A#                               A
sweeter is the silent voice left unopen

My girlfriend ran away married a man in 
seattle who is twice her age
he's got maturity and money and a place for her to stay
I'm unemployed and smoke pot all day

but as I see my babies black angels on parade
I sing a song I know they'll never sing
back into the dream calling me away
to the sea again one day

Everytime I go to sleep 
I wake up that nighttime nursery
Even in the morning light I hear them call daddy
While i bide the time and sing
