After Midnight
Eric Clapton

 - Peak Position #18 on 11/14/70    

After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang down
After midnight, we're gonna chug-a-lug and shout
We're gonna stimulate some action
We're gonna get some satisfaction
We're gonna find out what it is all about
After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang down

After midnight, we're gonna shake your tambourine
After midnight, it's all gonna be peaches and cream		    
We're gonna cause talk and suspiction
We're gonna give an exhibition
We're gonna find out what it is all about
After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang down

After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang down

REPEAT SECOND VERSE	

After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang down
After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang down
After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang down
After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang down
