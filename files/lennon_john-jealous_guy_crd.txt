Jealous Guy (Lennon)

This is a bit of a mix of the Lennon original and the Roxy Music
cover...
(Chord definitions at end of file)
As far as I can hear, all chords are correct as is the tab'd solo,
which has been missing from other versions.

Intro:  G Em D D7 Em

G         Em              D   D6
    I was dreaming of the past
D7                           Em   Em#5
    and my heart was beating fast.
Em6                    D    Dsus4 D
    I began to lose control,
Em      Em7            C
    I began to lose control.

chorus:
  G            Dm/F         C   Dsus4
      I didn't mean to hurt you,
  G             Dm/F   Bb           
      I'm sorry that I made you cry.
  G            D            Em  Em7
      I didn't mean to hurt you,

      I'm just a jealous guy.


G         Em          D   D6 
    I was feeling insecure,
D7                           Em   Em#5
    you might not love me anymore.
Em6                    D    Dsus4 D
    I was shivering inside,
Em        Em7          C
    I was shivering inside.

chorus

G         Em                   D    D6

D7                                 Em     Em#5
    thought that you was trying to hide.
Em6                     D  Dsus4  D
    I was swallowing my pain,
Em        Em7           C
    I was swallowing my pain.

chorus

      I'm just a jealous guy, look out, babe,
  C                      G
      I'm just a jealous guy.
