HAS BEENS AND ALSO RANS-F# A E B/D#, F# E7 A D7

Over there is Burton Cummings he's knitting me a brow
In kitchen is Tandyn Almer he smokes a stovepipe now
Outside is Mars Bonfire he's cleaning up his act
Coming up the path is Kerry Livgren, He's bringing Terry Jacks

They're drinking up O'Doul's and eating mock turtle soup
They drive red Ugos and don their Lycra blended suits
They have plugs in their scalp 
porcelain caps on their teeth
and wear base, mascara and blush
Their noses are scarred by the plastic surgeon
who was an intern at the time, in a rush  

Down the road lives Gerry Rafferty he just had another girl
Messina's got a brand new Geo, and Zolly's sails unfurl
Andy Kim's got distemper, Nick Gilder's getting cramps
Gary Neuman's frying coneys and Donny Most is licking stamps

Bo Donaldson is waiting for the ferry to the mainland
While Pat Benetar pours herself another bowl of raisin bran
Poor Donald Felder's residuals have just now run quite dry
And Mungo Jerry's moved away to return to the public eye

For here do we find them the few the proud the obscure
Their facades have now melted and their souls are now pure
They can feel human far from maddening crowd  
They can relax and enjoy life where feelings and dignity is allowed
