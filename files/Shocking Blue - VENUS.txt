Someone else posted this a couple months ago...I changed a couple
little mistakes.  But I didn't figure it out.  (Was this one of
Ludwig Alberter's, maybe?)

 
VENUS (by Shocking Blue)
 
The intro is a fast rythmic tremolo on B7sus4. I  play it with a bar on
the seventh fret:  797977  and afterwards slide the pointer finger
quickly on the E-string from 7 down to 0 to play the Em: 022000
 
 
Intro: Bsus2
 
  Em           A        Em      A
A goddess on a mountain top
 Em            A        Em      A
burning like a silver flame,
  Em         A         Em    A
Summit of beauty and love,
   Em             A      Em  (single notes: E E G A B B A G)
and Venus was her name.
      Am     D  Am       D         Em      A  Em  A
She's got it,     yeah baby, she's got it.
 C7             B7              Em          A  Em  A
I'm your Venus, I'm your fire at your desire.
 
 
Her weapon's are her crystal eyes
making every man mad.
Black as the dark night she was,
got what no one else had.
She's got it, yeah baby, she's got it.
I'm your Venus, I'm your fire at your desire.
Well, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire at your desire.
