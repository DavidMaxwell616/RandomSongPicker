SINGING THE BLUES
Recorded by Gail Davies
Written by Melvin Endsley

      C                      F
Well, I never felt more like singin' the blues
       C                    G 
'Cause I never thought that I'd ever lose
     F           G                   C 
Your love dear, why'd you do me this way
                             F 
Well, I never felt more like cryin' all night
       C                         G  
'Cause everything's wrong, there ain't nothin' right
         F   G                      C 
Without you, you got me singin' the blues.

        F              C 
Now the moon and stars no longer shine
    F               C
The dream is gone I thought was mine
        F                C
There's nothin' left for me to do
                 G 
But Cry-y-y over you (cry over you)
      C                      F 
Well, I never felt more like runnin' away
    C                 G 
But how can I go when I couldn't stay
        F    G                      C
Without you, you got me singin' the blues.

(Slightly different words in 2nd chorus)
WELL, the moon and stars no longer shine
AND the dream is gone THAT I thought was mine
There's nothin' left for me to do
But CRY, CRY, CRY, CRY over [G] you (cry over you)
Well, I never felt more like runnin' away
But how can I go when I couldn't stay
Without you, you got me singin' the blues.

Without you, you got me singin' the blues.
