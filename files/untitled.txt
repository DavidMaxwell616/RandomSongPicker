pie eyed plagiarist
courting compromise
warm heartini with a graceful twist
lights the fire in her eyes
forever scandals bore you
with faith comes atrophy
weeping widows line your pockets
throw another zealot on the fire
you're staying home tonight
to nurse imaginary wounds
unreachable goals are in your sites
their echoes bring you bloodlit moons
lazy limbs betray your fury
tired references to crass allegiance
thirsty acolytes prey upon the grand jury
