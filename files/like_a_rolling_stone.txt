C                     Dm7
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Em                        F               G 
Threw the bums a dime and in your prime, didn't you?
C                     Dm7          Em
People'd call, say, "Beware doll, you're bound to fall"
F                    G
You thought they all were kiddin' you
F            G
You used to laugh about
F                   G
Everybody that was hangin' out
F          Em    Dm      C        
  Now you don't talk so loud
F          Em    Dm      C
  Now you don't seem so proud
Dm                             F             G
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.

How does it feel
             C   F  G
How does it feel
               C   F  G             
To be on your own
                   C   F  G
With no direction home
             C     F   G
A complete unknown
                 C     F  G
Like a rolling stone?

(pre-verse lick)

You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely Bird
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
And nobody has ever taught you how to live on the streets
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it
You said you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And he says, "hey baby, how'd would you like to uh.. make a deal?"

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Look at ya! Like a rolling stone!

(missing verse)
You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns
When they all come down and did tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal.

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They all laughin' drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts and things
But you'd better take your diamond ring, I think you'd better pawn it babe
(yes I know I missed a verse, don't worry)
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the sweet talk that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.

How does it feel
How does it feel, baby
To be on your own
No direction home
A complete unknown
Look at ya! Like a rolling stone!
