Moon River
==========
music Henry Mancini, lyrics Johnny Mercer

Transcribed by Graham Hawkins (ghawkins@comp.vuw.ac.nz)

This song is from the movie Breakfast At Tiffany's. It won the 
Oscar for Best Song in 1961, and also Best Score. As you probably
know the song was sung by Audrey Hepburn, and BTW her fingering 
was spot on! :-)

All tab and lyrics are as I hear them in the film. 

F#    D#m   B           F#M7/A#
Moon River wider than a mile,
     B              F#M7/A#      G#m7  A#7 
I'm crossin' you in style, some day.
    D#m F#7/C#     B    E/B
Oh Dreammaker you heartbreaker,
    D#m        C7  F       A#7 D#m       G#7  C#
Wherever  your go-in', I'm  go-in' your way.

F#    D#m      B           F#M7/A#
Two drifters off to see the world;
         B            F#M7/A#    G#m7  A#7 
There's such a lot of world   to see.
       D#m C#m7    D#m/C   B           F#M7/A#
We're   af-ter the same   rainbow's   end,
B                 F#/A# B               F#M7/A#    
Waitin' round the bend, my huckleberry friend.
      C#        B  F#M7/A# G#m F#
Moon River and me.

 F#M7/A#
