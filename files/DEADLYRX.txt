The Complete Grateful Dead Lyrics

There is more than just lyrics here, I have also included 
inline guitar chord transcriptions, some from where I first 
got the lyrics, and others that I have managed to figure out 
by ear.  The page itself is divided into sections by the first 
letters of each song.

       A Little Light  [Mydland/Barlow]

       Well, there ain't nobody safer than someone who doesn't care.
       And it isn't even lonely when no one's ever there.
       I had a lot of dreams once, but some of them came true.
       The honey's sometimes bitter when fortune falls on you.

       So you know I've been a soldier in the armies of the night.
       And I'll find the fatal error in what's otherwise alright.
       But here you're trembling like a sparrow, I will try with all my might
       To give you just a little sweetness
       Just a little sweetness
       Just a little light.

       I have always heard that virtue ought to be its own reward,
       But it never comes so easy when you're living by the sword.
       It's even harder to be heartless when you look at me that way.
       You're as mighty as the flower that will grow the stones away.

       Even though I been a stranger, full or irony and spite
       Holding little but contempt for all things beautiful and bright,
       Something shines around you and it seems, to my delight
       To give me just a little sweetness
       Just a little sweetness
       Just a little sweetness
       Just a little light.

       Bridge:
       It could be just another highway coiled up in the night.
       You could be just another mule deer, baby, stranded on my brights
       There's a tingling recognition, like the sound of distant thunder
       And I begin to wonder, if the love I've driven under won't ignite.

       (instrumental)

       So you know I've been a soldier in the armies of the night.
       And I'll find the fatal error in what's otherwise alright.
       Something shines around you that seems, to my delight
       To give me just a little sweetness
       Just a little sweetness
       Just a little sweetness
       Just a little light.

       Ain't It Crazy (The Rub)  [S.Hopkins]

       Man got the rub on, sister got the rub
       They're goin' around doing the rub, the rub
       Ain't it crazy, ain't it crazy
       Ain't it crazy one day keep on rubbin' that thing.

       Two old ladies was lying around in bed
       One turned over and this is what she said,

       Mama tell the chicken her body was a duck
       Put him on the table with his feet sticking up

       Two old ladies playing in the sand
       Each one wishing the other was a man

       Well I see that woman goin behind the hill
       I'm gonna find that girl, I'm gonna do my will

       Well I feel so good, well I feel so fine
       All I gotta do is drink that wine

       I say the little old rooster called the little old hen
       He said he had no lungs, ain't got no wing.


       Ain't Superstitious / Meet Me On The Bottom  [W.Dixon]

       Meet me on the bottom, bring me my running shoes,
       When I come out the window, we ain't got time to lose.

       Well I ain't superstitious, but a black cat crossed my trail,
       Don't brush me with my broom, Babe, I just might land in jail.

       Well my right hand itchin', Babe, I get smothered by the shore,
       Look down you engine, Babe, but somebody got to go.

       Meet me on the bottom, Babe, bring me my running shoes,
       When I come out the window, Babe, we ain't got time to lose.

       Well I hope you are listening, when I come streaking by,
       Got a bad old man, Babe, and I'm too young to die.

       Well I ain't superstitious, but a black cat crossed my trail,
       Don't brush me with my broom, Babe, I just might land in jail.

       Dogs been barking all around my neighborhood,
       You give a sign, babe, ain't do nobody no good.


       Alabama Getaway  [Garcia/Hunter]

       [Intro: E D C]

       A
       32 teeth in a jawbone, Alabama trying for none,
         E                         D                              C
       Before I have to hit him, I hope he's got the sense to run.
       A
       Reason the poor girls love him, promise them everything,
       E                            D                        C
       Why they all believe him? He wears a big diamond ring.

       [Chorus]
       A                          D
       Alabama getaway, getaway.  Alabama getaway, getaway,
       E                          D                                     C

       Major Domo Billy Bojangles, sit down and have a drink with me,
       "What's this about Alabama?  It keeps a coming back to me.

       49 sister states had Alabama in their eyes.

       [Chorus]
       [Jam on chorus chords]

       Major said why don't we give him rope enough to hang himself?
       No need to worry the jury, they're bound to take care of themselves.
       23rd psalm Major Domo, reserve me a table for three,
       Down in the valley of the shadow, just you, Alabama, and me.

       All Along The Watchtower  [Dylan]

       [Intro/Chords: Bm A G A]

       There must be some way out of here said the joker to the thief.
       There's to much confusion, I can't get no relief.
       Businessmen they drink my wine.
       Plowmen dig my earth.
       None of them along the line knows what any of it is worth.

       [Jam]

       No reason to get excited, the thief he kindly spoke.
       There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
       But you and I have been through that and this is not our fate.
       So let us not talk falsely know the hour is getting late.

       [Jam]

       All along the watchtower princes kept the view.
       While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too
       Outside in the cold distance a wildcat did growl.
       Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl.

       [Jam]

       All Over Now  [B.Womack]

       Well now baby used to stay all night long, made me cry,
       Lord she done me wrong.
       Hurt my eyes open, and that's no lie, tables turnin',
       Now it's her turn to cry,
       Cuz I used to love her, but it's all over now.

       Well I used to wake up in the morning, get my breakfast in bed,
       When I got worried, you know she eased my achin' head,
       But now she's here and there with every man in town'
       Still tryin' to take for that same old clown.
       Cuz I used to love her, but it's all over now.

       Well she used to run around with every man in town,
       Spend all my money, Lord I better pass "go",
       Put me out, it was a pity how I cried, table's turnin',
       Now it's her turn to cry,
       Cuz I used to love her, but it's all over now.
       Yes and I used to love her, but it's all over now.

       You may be saturday's child, all alone, moving with a tinge of grace.
       You may be a clown in the burying ground or just another pretty face.
       You may meet the fate of Ophelia, sleeping and perchance to dream.
       Honest to the point of recklessness, self-centered in the extreme.

       Ain't nobody messing with you but you.
       Your friends are getting most concerned.
       Loose with the truth baby, it's your fire.
       But baby, I hope you don't get burned.
       When the smoke has cleared she said, that's what she said to me.
       Gonna want a bed to lay your head and a little sympathy.

       Can't talk to you without talking to me,
       We're guilty of the same old thing.
       Been talking alot about less and less
       And forgetting the love we bring.

       Walking in Jerusalem just like John (goodnight, goodnight)
       I would never ride, well, I would never ride  (goodnight, goodnight)
       But His rod and His staff, they comfort me (goodnight, goodnight)
       Tell "A" for the ark, that wonderful boat (goodnight, goodnight)
       Tell "B" for the beast at the ending of the wood (goodnight,goodnight)
       You know it ate all the children when they wouldn't be good,
       Walking in Jerusalem just like John (goodnight, goodnight)
       I go walking in the valley of the shadow of death,
       And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight.

       Lay down my dear brother, lay down and take your rest,
       Won't you lay your head upon your savior's breast?
       I love you all but Jesus loves you the best
       And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight.
       And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight.

       Hey! Now reelin' and a rockin', what a crazy sound,
       Well no they never stopped rockin' till the moon went down.

              E      A     E     A       E  B   A        E
       In the attics of my life, full of cloudy dreams unreal.
       A       E         A          E     A   E B       A        E   A
       Full of tastes no tongue can know, and lights no eyes can see.

       When there was no ear to hear, you sang to me.

       I have spent my life seeking all that's still unsung.
       A       E      A        E     A   E B       A       E   A
       Bent my ear to hear the tune, and closed my eyes to see.

       In the book of love's own dream, where all the print is blood.

       Babe, It Ain't No Lie  [E.Cotten]

       Been all around this whole round world,
       Lord, I just got back to day.
       Worked all the way honey and I gave it all to you
       Honeybabe, what more can I do?

       Oh babe, it ain't no lie.
       Oh babe, it ain't no lie.
       Oh babe, it ain't no lie.
       You know this life I'm living is mighty high.

       One more woman, Lord in this town.
       Keep her telling her lies on me.
       Wish to my soul that old woman would die.
       Keep her telling her lies on me.


       It's All Over Now Baby Blue  [Dylan]

       [Intro: Em G D]

       A                                 G        D
       You must leave, now take what you need you think will last.
               A                          G      D
       But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast.
     Em                   G               D
       Yonder stands your orphan with his gun;
     Em                   G           D
       He's crying like a fire in the sun.
     F#                                      A       A D A
       Look out; all those saints are coming through.
           Em            G        D     Em G D  Em G D
       And it's all over now Baby Blue.

       The highway is for gamblers, you better use your sense.
       Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
       The empty handed painter from your streets
       Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets.
       The sky too is folding under you,
       And it's all over know Baby Blue.

       [Jam]

       All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
       All your empty-handed armies are all going home.
       Your lover who has just walked out your door
       Has taken all his blankets from the floor.
       The carpet too is moving under you,
       And it's all over now Baby Blue.

       Leave your stepping stones behind, there's something calls for you.
       Forget about the dead you've left, they will not follow you.
       The vagabond who's rapping at your door,
       Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
       Strike another match, go start anew,
       And it's all over now Baby Blue. And it's all over now Baby Blue.
       And it's all over now Baby Blue. And it's all over now Baby Blue.

       Baby, What Do You Want Me To Do  [J.Reed]

       You got me running, you got me hiding,
       You got me running, hiding, hiding, running,
       Anywhere you want it, let it roll, yeah, yeah, yeah,
       Hey, you got me where you want me, baby doing what you want me to do.

       Going up, going down, going up, down, down, up,
       Anyway you want it, let it roll, yeah, yeah, yeah,
       Yeah, you got me where you want me, baby doing what you want me to do.

       I say, honey baby, honey you don't have to go,
       I'm going to pack my bag, baby, down that road I go,
       Roll on, roll on baby, honey what is wrong with you?
       Now baby, baby, baby,...
       Oh baby, honey what is wrong with you?
       You don't treat your baby, treat me like you used to do.


       Ballad Of A Thin Man  [Dylan]

       You walk into the room, with your pencil in your hand,
       You see somebody naked, and you say, "Who is that man?"
       You try so hard, but you don't understand
       Just what you'll say when you get home.

       Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is
       Do you, Mister Jones?

       You raise up your head, and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
       And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
       And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
       And you say, "Oh my God, am I here all alone?"

       Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is
       Do you, Mister Jones?

       You hand in your ticket, and you go watch the geek
       Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak.
       And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
       And you say, "Impossible" as he hands you a bone.

       Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is
       Do you, Mister Jones?

       You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
       To get you facts when somebody attacks your imagination
       But nobody has any respect anyway they already expect you
       To just give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations

       You've been with the professors and they've all liked your looks
       With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks
       You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books
       You're very well read it's well known.

       Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is
       Do you, Mister Jones?

       Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels
       He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
       And without further notice he asks you how it feels
       And he says, "Here is your throat back thanks for the loan."

       Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is
       Do you, Mister Jones?

       Now you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "NOW"
       And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"

       And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow
       Give me some milk or else go home."

       Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is
       Do you, Mister Jones?

       Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown
       You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose to the ground
       There ought to be a law against you comin' around
       You should be made to wear earphones.

       Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is
       Do you, Mister Jones?

       Ballad of Casey Jones  [Traditional]

       G                   C                 G
       One sunday morning alone in a driving rain,
      G                        A         D
       Around the curve came a passenger train,
      G                  C      G
       In the cabin stood Casey Jones,
       G
       Bold engineer but he's dead and gone.

       Casey Jones was an old engineer,
       Call for to family tonight, tonight you will fear,
       All I need is my water and my coal,
       Look out the windows, see my drag wheel roll.

       Mrs. Casey when she heard the news,
       Sitting on the bed she was lacing up her shoes.
       Children, children, now catch your breath,
       You will draw a pension if your Papa's dead.

       Children, children, now get your hat,
       Tell me Mama what do you mean by that?
       Get your hat, put it on your head,
       Go down in town, see your Daddy is dead.

       Casey said just before he died,
       Fix the blinds so that the bums can ride,
       If they ride, let them ride the rods,
       Put their trust in the hands of God.

       Casey said just before he died,
       Two more roads that I want to ride.
       People said, what roads, Casey, can they be?
       Gold Colorado and the Santa Fe.


       Bear Tracks  [?]

       High on the mountain tell me what do you see,
       Bland shacks and railroad tracks looking back at me,
       Better take Chicago Forest to the plain,
       There's a Colorado River running through the green,
       You been hanging around this world far too long,
       Lord, at night for countless hours certainly are gone,
       Never been an outlaw, never been this free,
       Except for tales of Colorado spring,
       Take up my money, thought I'd be free,
       Saw that man a commin' thought they were that free,
       Chopped down that tree and my worries were all gone,
       All of a sudden bullets were ringing through that home,
       You been hanging around this world for far too long,
       Hanging around the mountain home, back in half an hour,
       Way back in the swamp, boys way back in the trees,
       Colorado payroll in the Colorado spring,
       You hear them coming, the voices of love,
       You must come courting through this world or go,
       Texas in the dell, running in the well,
       You know all you can do is raise hell,
       Stick around this world for far too long,
       Back in half an hour with the...
       Way back in the swamps, way back in the trees,
       Never been this free in the Colorado spring,
       As sun come up as alive as I can be.


       Beat it on Down The Line  [J.Fuller]

       Well this job I've got is just a little too hard,
       Running out of money, Lord, I need more pay.
       Gonna wake up in the morning Lord, gonna pack my bags,
       I'm gonna beat it on down the line.
       I'm goin' down the line, goin down the line,
       Goin' down the line, goin down the line,
       Goin' down the line, goin down the line,
       Beat it on down the line.

       Yes I'll be waiting at the station Lord, when that train pulls on by,
       I'm going back where I belong.
       I'm going back to that same old used-to-be,
       Down in Joe Brown's coal mine.

       Coal mine, coal mine, coal mine, coal mine.
       Coal mine, coal mine, coal mine, coal mine.
       Coal mine, coal mine, coal mine, coal mine.
       Down in Joe Brown's coal mine.

       Yeah, I'm goin' back to that shack way across that railroad track,
       Uh huh, that's where I think I belong.

       And that's where I'm gonna make my happy home.

       Lulu, my Lulu, come and open the door.
       Lulu, my Lulu, come and open the door.

       Hang me, oh, hang me, so I'll be dead and gone.

       Believe It Or Not  [Garcia/Hunter]

       Just a few moments, just a piece of your time,
       Is all I am asking, and I'll give you mine.
       Just a few moments, out of all you have got,
       To show how I love you, believe it or not.
       To show how I love you, believe it or not.

       I know I'm no angle, my prospect's alright.
       As a firm mind in sorrow, when the rivers run dry.
       But I roll up my shirt sleeves and give my best shot,
       To show that I love you, believe it or not.
       Just to show that I love you, believe it or not.

       Done time in the locker, done time on the street.
       Done time on the upswing, and time in defeat.
       I know what I'm asking, I know it's alot,
       To tell you I love you, believe it or not.
       To tell you I love you, believe it or not.

       Right now while the sun shines, on the crest of a hill.
       With the breeze and the fire and a red whip-or-whil,
       Making music together, in a word time forgot.
       Let me show how I love you, believe it or not.
       Let me show how I love you, believe it or not.

       Bertha don't you come around here anymore.

       Dressed myself in green, I went down unto the sea.
       Try to see what's goin' down, try to read between the lines.
       I had a feelin' I was fallin', fallin', fallin',
       I turned around to see,
       Heard a voice a' callin', Lord you was comin' after me.

       [Chorus]

       Ran into a rainstorm, ducked into a bar door.
       It's all night pourin', pourin' rain, Lord but not a drop on me.
       Test me, test me. Test me, test me. Why don't you arrest me?
       Throw me in the jailhouse,
       Lord until the sun goes down ('till it goes down).

       Big Boy Pete  [D.Harris/D.Terry]

       The joint was jumping on the corner down on Honky Tonk Street,
       All of a sudden up pulled a Cadillac and out stepped a can named Pete.
       A diamond on every finger, he wore he wore a tailor made suit,
       Black cigar, he wore a Stetson hat,
       He wore a pair on cowboy boots,
       Busted on through the door mad as he could be,
       Don't mess around, I'll cut you down 'cause my name is Big Boy Pete.
       The music stopped, there wasn't a sound,
       Up in the corner stood Bad Man Brown.
       He smiled and grinned, he said you know my friend,
       Take two steps further I'm going kick you in the hide,
       Forty-Five keep it alive, seven bullets on my side.
       Brown pulled a knife, jumped on Pete,
       Fought from the counter right on out to the street.
       They swung from the north, swung from the south,
       Pete got the blackjack out.
       Brown went out his mind, yes he did, now we deeply see,
       If you're ever down on the corner, down on Honky Tonk Street,
       Don't mess around he'll cut you down,
       Take a lesson from Big Boy Pete.

       Big River  [J.Cash]

       [Intro: A D A D A]

       [Chorus]
              A
       Well I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry,
       A                                   B          E
       Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.
       A                                     D7
       Tears I cried for that woman are gonna  flood you big river,
           A                     E           A   D A D A
       And I'm a gonna sit right here 'til I die.

       I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota,
       She tore me up everything I heard her drawl, that southern drawl.
       Well I heard my dream went back downstream, cavortin' in Davenport,
       And I follow you big river when you called.

       [Chorus]
       [Jam]

       Well I followed her down to St. Louie, later on down the river,
       Trader said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone.
       Well I followed her down to Memphis, but she just walked off the bus,
       She raised a few eyebrows and she went on down alone.

       [Chorus]
       [Jam]

       Well I've gotten on down to Baton Rouge, River Queen roll on,
       Take that woman down to New Orleans, New Orleans.
       I give up, I've had enough, followed my blues on down to the gulf,
       She loves you big river more than me.

       [Chorus]
       [Jam]
       [Chorus]
           A                     E           A
       And I'm a gonna sit right here 'til I die.
       And I'm a gonna sit right here 'til I die.

       Bird Song  [Garcia/Hunter]

       E
       All I know is something like a bird within her sang,
       E
       All I know she sang a little while and then flew on.
       C    G      D                   A                 E
       Tell me all that you know, I'll show you snow and rain.

       E
       If you hear that same sweet song again, will you know why?
       E
       Anyone who sings a tune so sweet is passin' by.
       C     G         D                A
       Laugh in the sunshine, sing, cry in the dark,
                       E
       Fly through the night.

       [Bridge]
 b c   C#m       B    A     E   B    A     E   B      A                E E9
       Don't cry now, don't you cry, don't you cry anymore. La la la la
 b c   C#m          B      A     E   B    A   E    B           A
       Sleep in the stars, don't you cry, dry your eyes on the wind.
                    E  E9
       La la la la. La.

       [Jam on E]

       If you hear that same sweet song again, will you know why?
       Anyone who sings a tune so sweet is passin' by.
       Laugh in the sunshine, sing, cry in the dark,
       Fly through the night.

       [Bridge]

       All I know is something like a bird within her sang,
       All I know she sang a little while and then flew on.
       Tell me all that you know, I'll show you snow and rain.
       Snow and rain.


       Blackbird  [Lennon/McCartney]

       Blackbird singing in the dead of night,
       Take these broken wings and learn to fly,
       All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to arise.

       Blackbird singing in the dead of night,
       Take these sunken eyes and learn to see,
       All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to be free.

       Blackbird fly, blackbird fly, into the light of the dark black night
       Blackbird fly, blackbird fly, into the light of the dark black night

       Blackbird singing in the dead of night,
       Take these broken wings and learn to fly,
       All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to arise.
       You were only waiting for this moment to arise,
       You were only waiting for this moment to arise.


       Black Muddy River  [Garcia/Hunter]

       When the last rose of summer pricks my finger,
       And the hot sun chills me to the bone,
       When I can't hear the song for the singer,
       And I can't tell my pillow from a stone,
       I will walk alone by the black muddy river,
       And sing me a song of my own,
       I will walk alone by the black muddy river,
       And sing me a song of my own.

       When the last bolt of sunshine hits the mountain,
       And the stars start to splatter in the sky,
       When the moon hits the southwest horizon,
       With the scream of an eagle on the fly,
       I will walk alone by the black muddy river,
       And listen to the ripples as they moan,
       I will walk alone by the black muddy river,
       And sing me a song of my own.

       Black muddy river, roll on forever,
       I don't care how deep or wide, if you've got another side,
       Roll muddy river, roll muddy river, black muddy river, roll.

       When it seems like the night will last forever,
       And there's nothing left to do but count the years,
       When the strings of my heart begin to sever,
       And stones fall from my eyes instead of tears,
       I will walk alone, by the black muddy river,
       And dream me a dream of my own,
       I will walk alone, by the black muddy river,
       And sing me a song of my own, sing me a song of my own.


       Black Peter  [Garcia/Hunter] (GD1)

       [Intro: A7]

     A7                         D7
       All of my friends come to  see me last night,
     A7                           D7
       I was laying in my bed and dying.
     Em         Bm          A   G F#m        Em                       D7
       Annie Bonneau from Saint Angel say the  weather down here so fine.

       |D7 . . .|. . . .|A7 . . .|. . . .|

       Just then the wind came squalling through the dark,
       But who can the weather command?
       Just want to have a little peace to die,
       And a friend or two I love at hand.

       |D7 . . .|. . . .|A7 . . .|. . . .|

       [Jam on verse chords]

       Fever roll up to a hundred and five.
       Roll on up, gonna roll back down.
       One more day I find myself alive,
       Tomorrow maybe go beneath the ground.

       |D7 . . .|. . . .|. . . .|. . . .|

       [Bridge]
      C                        Em
       See here how everything lead up to this day,
     Dm                   Am                  Em
       And it's just like any other day that's  ever been.
     Dm          G               C   Em    Am
       Sun going up and then the sun going down.
  Fmaj7                               C                   D7
       Shine through my window and my friends, they come around,
             Dm           Fmaj7   A7
       Come around, come around.

       The people might know, but the people don't care
       That a man can be as poor as me.
       Take a look at poor Peter, he's lying in pain,
       Now let's come run and see, run and see,
       Run and see, run, run and see, and see.

       Black Throated Wind  [Weir/Barlow]

       [Intro: E]

      E                       F#m
       You're bringing me down,  I'm running aground,
      D             A                           E
       Blind in the lights of the interstate cars,
      E             F#m
       Passing me by,  the busses and semis,
      D              A                              E
       Plunging like stones from a slingshot on mars.

      A        Bm          C#m  A D     C#m       Bm   A
       But I'm here by the road,   bound   to the load,
     Bm                                               E
       That I picked up in ten thousand cafes and bars.
      A Bm            C#m         A            D             C#m Bm A
       Alone with the rush of the drivers that won't pick me up,
     Bm                                               E
       The highway, the moon, and clouds and the stars.

     /D                   C#m         A
       Black throated wind,  keeps on pourin' in,
                                      Em             C A
       With its words of a life where nothing is new,
      D            C#m         A  Em        A
       Ah, Mother American Night,   I blast from the light,
      G   D                         A
       Oh Lord, and I'm drownin' in you.

       I left St. Louis, the City of Blues,
       In the midst of a storm I'd rather forget.
       I tried to pretend it came to an end,
       Cause you weren't the woman I once thought I'd met.

       But I can't deny, times have gone by,
       I never had doubts or thoughts of regret,
       And I was a man, when all this began,
       Who'd never think twice about being there yet.

       Black throated wind, whisper with sin,
       And speaks of a life that passes like dew.
       It's forced me to see, you've done better by me,
       Done better by me than I've done by you.

       Now what's to be found, racing around,
       You carry your pain wherever you go.
       All full of the blues, and tryin' to lose,
       You ain't gonna learn what you don't wanna know.

       So I give you my eyes, and all of their lies,
       Please help them to learn as well as to see.
       And capture a glance, oh, Lord, and make it dance,
       Of looking at you, looking at me.

       Black throated wind, keeps on pourin' in,
       With its words of a lie that could almost be true.
       Ah, Mother American Night, burst from the light.
       I'm turning around, that's what I'm gonna do.

      G                      D                         A
       Well I'm going back home that's what I'm gonna do.
       I'm turning around, that's what I'm gonna do.
       Lord I'm going back home that's what I'm gonna do.
       Cause you done better by me than I've done by you,
       Say whoa and I'm drowning in you.
       I'm going, going, going back home, that's what I'm gonna do.
       Going, going, going back home that's what I'm gonna do.
       Well you done better by me then I've done by you,
       So whoa, lord, and I'm drowning in you.
       Going, going, going back home that's what I'm gonna do.
       Well you done better by me then I've done by you,
       Whoa, lord, and I'm drowning in you.
       Whoa, lord, and I'm drowning in you.


       Blow Away  [Mydland/Barlow]

       A man and a woman come together as strangers.
       When they part they're usually strangers still.
       It's like a practical joke played on us by our Maker.
       Empty bottles that can't be filled.

       You fancy me to be the Master of your feelings.
       You barely bruise me with your looks to kill.
       Though I admit we were sometimes brutal in our dealings,
       I never held you against your will.

       [Chorus]:
       Baby, who's to say it coulda' been different now that it's done.
       (Baby, who's to say)
       Baby, who's to say that it shoulda' been anyway.
       (Baby, who's to say)
       Baby, who's to say that it even matters in the long run.
       (Baby, who's to say)
       Give it just a minute, and it'll blow away. It'll blow away.

       Your case against me is so very clearly stated
       I plead no contest, I just turn and I shrug.
       I've come to figure all importance overestimated.
       You must mean water when you beg for blood.


       Blues For Allah  [Garcia/Hunter] (GD2)

       Arabian wind, The needle's eye is thin,
       The ships of state sail on mirage,
       And drown in sand, Out in no-man's land where Allah does command.

       What good is spilling blood?  It will not grow a thing;
       Taste eternity the swords sing: Blues of Allah In 'sh'Allah.

       They lie where they fall,  There's nothing more to say,
       The desert stars are bright tonight lets meet as friends,
       The Flower of Islam, The Fruit of Abraham.

       The thousand stories have come round to one again,
       Arabian night, Our Gods pursue their fight,
       What fatal flowers of darkness bloom from seeds of light.

       Bird of paradise fly in white sky, Blues for Allah In 'sh'Allah,
       Let's see with our heart, These things our eyes have seen,
       And know the truth must still lie somewhere in between.

       Under eternity, under eternity, under eternity blue,
       Bird of paradise fly in white sky, Blues for Allah In 'sh'Allah.


       Bo Diddley  [B.Diddley]

       Hey, Bo Diddley dee.


       Bondi Pier  [?]

       I was down by Bondi Pier, drinkin' tubes of ice cold beer,
       With a bucket full of prawns upon my knee,
       When I swallowed the last prawn,
       I had a technicolor yawn and I chundered in the old Pacific Sea.

       Drink it up, drink it up,
       Crack another dozen tubes and prawns with me,
       If you want to throw your voice, mate you won't have any choice,
       But to chunder in the Old Pacific Sea.

       I was sittin in the surf, when a mate of mine called Murf,
       Asks if he can crack a tube or two with me.
       The bastard barely swallowed it,
       When he went for the big split,
       And he chundered in the Old Pacific sea.

       Drink it up, drink it up,
       Crack another dozen tubes and prawns with me,
       If you want to throw your voice, mate you won't have any choice,
       But to chunder in the Old Pacific Sea.

       I've had liquid laughs in cars, and I've hurled from moving cars,
       And I've chuckled when and where it suited me.
       But if I could choose the spot,
       To regurgitate me lot, then I'd chunder in the Old Pacific Sea.

       Drink it up, drink it up,
       Crack another dozen tubes and prawns with me,
       If you want to throw your voice, mate you won't have any choice,
       But to chunder in the Old Pacific Sea.


       Book of Rules (H. Johnsen/B. Llewellyn)

       Isn't it strange how princesses and kings
       Can clown their capers in sawdust rings,
       Just like poor people like you and me
       Will be builders for eternity;
       Each is given a bag of tools,
       Shapeless lines, and a book of rules.

       Each must make his life (as flowing ink/e'er as flown)
       A stumbling block or a stepping stone,
       Just like poor people like you and me
       Will be builders for eternity;
       Each is given a bag of tools,
       Shapeless lines, and a book of rules.

       Pow pa Pow Pow, Pow Wa-Pa-Pa Pow Pow
       Wa-pa-pa-pow pow, wa-pow pa pow pow pow.

       And I say small people like you and me
       Will be builders for eternity;
       Each is given a bag of tools,
       Shapeless masks, and a book of rules.

       Look where the rain is fallen from the sky.
       I know the sun will be only missing for awhile.
       And I say poor people like you and me
       Will be builders for eternity;
       Each is given a bag of tools,
       Shapeless masks, and a book of rules.

       Pow pa Pow Pow, Pow Wa-Pa-Pa Pow Pow
       Wa-pa-pa-pow pow, wa-pow pa pow pow pow.

       And I say small people like you and me
       Will be builders for eternity;
       Each is given a bag of tools,
       Shapeless lives, and a book of rules.

       Pow pa Pow Pow, Pow Wa-Pa-Pa Pow Pow
       Wa-pa-pa-pow pow, wa-pow pa pow pow pow.  (4X)


       Born Cross-Eyed  [Weir] (GDA)

       Seems like I've been here before,
       Fuzzy then and still so obscure, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
       And I don't want to see anybody cry,
       Meet me some mornin' in the sweet by and by, by and by, by and by.

       Song comin' on,
       So pleasin' to see, come and gone, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,
       You don't have to tell me why,
       Meet me some mornin' in the sweet by and by, by and by, by and by.

       It ain't cause I'm the only one left darlin',
       Bout the time the sun rises west,
       Feelin' groovy, lookin' fine.

       Think I'll come back here again,
       Every now and then from time to time.
       My how lovely you are, my dear,
       The ball game has gone much too far my dear,
       Sing to me, do your thing to me,
       I'll meet you some mornin', meet you some mornin',
       In the sweet by and by, by and by, by and by.

      D              G               Am            Em      D
       What do you want me to do, to do for you to see you through?
           C               D                  Am               G
       For this is all a dream we dreamed one afternoon, long ago.

       Walk out of any doorway, feel your way,
       Feel your way like the day before.
       Maybe you'll find direction,
       Around some corner where it's been waiting to meet you.
      D              G               Am                         Em  D
       What do you want me to do, to watch for you while you're sleeping?
            Am                     C              G             D
       Then please don't be surprised when you find me dreaming too.

       Look into any eyes you find by you; you can see clear to another day.
       Maybe been seen before,
       Through other eyes on other days while going home.
      D              G               Am            Em      D
       What do you want me to do, to do for you to see you through?
            C              Em               D           G
       It's all a dream we dreamed one afternoon, long ago.

       Walk into splintered sunlight,
       Inch your way through dead dreams to another land.
       Maybe you're tired and broken,
       Your tongue is twisted with words half spoken and thoughts unclear.
      D              G               Am            Em      D
       What do you want me to do, to do for you to see you through?
         Am               C                  G                 D
       A box of rain will ease the pain, and love will see you through.

      G                    Am       Em
       Just a box of rain, wind and water,
         C                  A              D
       Believe it if you need in, if you don't just pass it on.
      G                Am       Em
       Sun and shower, wind and rain,
         C              D              Em          A     (Asus4)
       In and out the window like a moth  before a flame.

                D              Em             G                D
       And it's just a box of rain, I don't know who put it there;
                           Bm           G              A
       Believe it if you need it, or leave it if you dare.
               D               Em           G              D
       And it's just a box of rain, or a ribbon for your hair;
             Em                                G                D C G D Asus4
    Such a long long time to be gone, and a short time to be there.


       Boys in the Barroom  [Hunter]

       Does God look down on the boys in the barroom,
       Mainly forsaken but surely not judged.
       Jacks, kings, and aces, their faces in wine,
       Do lord deliver our kind.
       From singing for whiskey three strings on the fiddle,
       Four on the guitar and a song that I love.
       Many's the night we spent picking and singing,
       In hopes it be pleasing both here and above.
       Jack's string fiddle to my sawtooth bow,
       Who loves lonlieness loves it alone.
       I love the dim lights like some love the dew,
       Only thing I wonder sometimes:
       Does God look down on the boys in the barroom,
       Mainly forsaken but surely not judged.
       Jacks, kings, and aces, their faces in wine,
       Do lord deliver our kind.

       Why don't you just bring me my shotgun,
       Bring me back a pocket full of shells,

       You know there's gonna be some trouble 'round here.

       Well you know my mama told me, she said,
       You gonna have bad luck, son, don't care where you go,

       She lets her rolling go moonshine bright,
       In the morning bring me my shotgun,
       Well I can stand in the mist for a while,
       But I can't stand it for very long.

       Goin' home, goin' home, by the waterside I will rest my bones.
       Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul.

       Going to plant a weeping willow;
       On the bank's green edge it will grow, grow, grow.
       Singin' a lullaby beside the water
       Lovers come and go, the river roll, roll, roll.

       Fare you well, fare you well, I love you more than words can tell.
       Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul.
       I'm gonna listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul.


       Broken Arrow by Robbie Robertson
          
       Who else is gonna bring you
       A broken arrow
       Who else is gonna bring you
       A bottle of rain
       There he goes, moving across the water
       There he goes turning my whole
       world around
              
       Do you feel what I feel
       Can we make that it's part of the deal
       I gotta hold you in these arms of steel
       Lay your heart on the line...this time
               
       I wanna breathe when you breathe
       When you whisper like that hot
       Summer breeze
       Count the beads of sweat that cover me
       Didn't you show me a sign, this time
                 
       Who else is gonna bring you
       A broken arrow
       Who else is gonna bring you
       A bottle of rain
       There he goes, moving across the water
       There he goes turning my whole
       world around
                     
       Can you see what I see
       Can you cut behind the mystery
       I will meet you by the witness tree
       Leave the whole world behind
                      
       I want to come when you call
       I'll get to you if I have to crawl
       They can't hold me with these iron walls
       We've got mountains to climb
                       
       Who else is gonna bring you
       A broken arrow
       Who else is gonna bring you
       A bottle of rain
       There he goes, moving across the water
       There he goes turning my whole world around
                          


       Brother Esau  [Weir/Barlow]

       My brother Esau killed the hunter, back in 1969,
       Before the killing was done his inheritance was mine.
       When at first my brother walked away,
       Before a weary band,
       Esau gave his sleeplessness for a piece of moral land.

       Our father favored Esau, he was eager to obey,
       All the wild commandments, the old man shot his way.
       But all this ended when, my brother failed at war,
       He staggered home and found me in the door.

       Esau skates on mirrors anymore
       Meets his pale reflection at the door.
       Sometimes at night I dream, he's still that hairy man,
       Shadow boxing the apocalypse, wandering the land.

       Esau holds the blessing, brother Esau holds the curse,
       I was thinking that the blame was mine,
       But suspected something worse.
       The more my brother looks like me, the more I understand,
       The silent war it bloodied both our hands.
       Sometimes at night I think I understand.
       None of us can win.
       Outside that dream, still that hairy man.
       Well sometimes at night I think I understand.
       Shadowboxing the apocalypse, wandering the land.



       Brown-Eyed Women  [Garcia/Hunter] (GDA)

       [Intro: |C#m . . .|E . . .|A . . .|. .|E . . .|. . . .| ]

    C#m                           E
       Gone are the days when the ox fall down,
      B                              A
       Take up the yoke and plow the fields around.
    C#m                           E
       Gone are the days when the ladies said, "Please,
       A                                     E
       Gentle Jack Jones won't you come to me."

       [Chorus]
       B
       Brown-eyed women and red grenadine.
           A                        E          B
       The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean.
       A                               E          C#m
       Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down,
              F#m                     A        E
       And it looks like the old man's gettin' on.

       1920 when he stepped to the bar, drank to the dregs of the whiskey jar
       1930 when the wall caved in. He'd made his way selling red-eyed gin.

       [Chorus]
       [Jam on verse chords twice]

       Delilah Jones was the mother of twins,
       Two times over and the rest were sins.
       Raised eight boys, only I turned bad,
       Didn't get the lickin's that the other ones had.

       [Chorus]

       [Bridge]
     Bm                    A         E
       Tumble-down shack in Big Foot County.
     Bm                        A           E
       Snowed so hard that the roof caved in.
    C#m           B          A         G#m
       Delilah Jones went to meet her god,
               A                              E
       And the old man never was the same again.

       Daddy made whiskey and he made it well.
       Cost two dollars and it burned like hell.
       I cut hick'ry just to fire the still,
       Drink down a bottle and be ready to kill.

       [Chorus]

       Gone are the days when the ox fall down,
       Take up the yoke and plow the fiends around.
       Gone are the days when the ladies said' "Please,
       Gentle Jack Jones won't you come to me."

       [Chorus]

              F#m                     A        E
       And it looks like the old man's getting on.


       Built to Last  [Garcia/Hunter]

       There are times when you must beckon,
       There are times when you must fall.
       You can take a lot of reckoning,
       But you can't take it all.

       There are times when I can help you out,
       And times when you must fall.
       There are times when you must live in doubt,
       And I can't help at all.

       Two blue stars, shine o'er the hill.
       Plead no more, now just be still.
       Through the night, now safely there.
       Show me something built to last.

       Been held by the fire,
       Yes and I'm, held by the ring.
       You can walk on balls of fire,
       But sometimes you might bleed.

       There are times when I have begged you
       And you do the same to me.
       If you can't or won't admit it,
       At least we pulled you through.

       Three blue stars, set o'er the hill.
       Call them back; you never will.
       All these trials, soon be dead.
       We all need something built to last.

       Built to last 'till time of seven,
       Falls tumbling from the sky.
       Built to last 'till lightness fades,
       And darkness falls on all.
       Built to last 'till years roll back
       Our couch perched in the sky
       Show me something different,
       Or something built to try.

       There are times when you get hit up on,
       Try hard but you cannot give.
       Other times, you'd gladly go
       with what you need to give.

       Don't be afraid to save your face,
       When you have done your best
       Now I won't forget,
       Next day try the rest.

       All the stars, are gone but one.
       Morning dreams, we found the Sun.
       Through the night, now safely there,
       Show me something built to last

       Two blue stones, shine o'er the hill.
       Call it back; you never will
       All these trials, now are dead.
       Show me something built to last.
       All the stars, are gone but one.
       Morning dreams. Here comes the sun.
       Through the night, now sinking fast.
       Show me something built to last.


       California Earthquake  [Rodney Crowell]

       There was a California earthquake, in the year of '83
       That shook the living daylights out of the Owen's County sea
       There weren't a building still left standing when the dust had cleared away
       Just a rumble in the distance all the way to San Andre

       Well Sherman Buck was driving his old mule into town
       When the big one came that shook so hard, 
       it knocked him to the ground
       Lord there opened up a hole so big, 
       he just knew that his time was up
       And it swallowed up that poor old mule 
       and it just missed Sherman Buck

       (chorus)
       California earthquake you just don't know what you've done
       We might fall off in the ocean, 
       Lord, but you never make us run
       You're a partner to the devil, 
       but we ain't afraid of him
       And we'll build ourselves another town so you can tear it down again

       And there came the quake of '99 that levelled Mission Creek
       The earth was like an ocean churning, 
       with waves of twenty feet
       Lord it sounded like a thousand trains were screaming underground
       Clean across to San Joachim, 
       folks heard that mournful sound

       Then it came one day a holocaust and it rocked the Frisco Bay
       Miles of walls came tumbling down like on Jericho that day
       Mighty near everything that the eartquake missed, 
       a full day fire consumed
       And just left the smoke and the ashes of the dreams 
       that they had burned

       Pretty lady ain't got no friend till the Candyman comes around
       Again.

       I come in from Memphis where I learned to talk the jive,
       When I get back to Memphis there'll be one less man alive.
       Good morning Mr. Benson, I see you're doing well,
       If I had me a shotgun I'd blow you straight to hell.

       [Chorus]
       [Jam on verse chords]

       Come on boys and wager if you have got the mind,
       If you've got a dollar, boys lay it on the line,
       Hand me my old guitar, pass the whiskey 'round,
       Won't you tell everybody you meet that the Candyman's in town.

       [Chorus] (F C)
       [Chorus]


       Can't Come Down  [?]

       Well I'm flying down desert streets wrapped in mother's wine & sheets
       Asbestos boots on flaming feet dreaming of forbidden treats,
       When uniforms on nighttime beats ask me where I'm going & what I eat.
       I answer them with a voice so sweet,

       I can't come down till it's plain to see.
       I can't come down I've been set free.
       Who you are and what you do don't make no difference to me.

       Well someone trying to tell me where it's at,
       And how I do this and why I do that,
       With secret smiles like a Chesire cat,
       And little wings like a vampire bat,
       I fly away to my cold water flat and eat my way to a bone of fat,
       And I say to the man with the funny hat,

       They say I'll be good to lose my grip,
       My hold on reality is starting to slip,
       To tell me to got off with this trip,
       The say its like a sinking ship,
       Life is sweet it's too warm to sip,
       And if I drink I'll chuck and flip, I'll just say as I take a nip,

       Oh I dream of cotton seas and granite walls and redwood trees,
       And ugly eye that only sees endless mirrors and infinite me's,
       About the winter's coming freeze this afterthought I say with ease,
       To all of you who make your fees.

       Catfish John  [B.McDill/A.Reynolds]

       Mama said, "Don't go near that river,
       Don't be hanging around old Catfish John."
       Come in the morning I'd always be there,
       Walking in his footsteps in the sweet Delta dawn.

       Take me back to another morning, to a time so long ago,
       When the sweet magnolia blossomed, cotton fields as white as snow.

       Catfish John was a river hobo who lived and died by the river's bed,
       Looking back I still remember I was proud to be his friend.

       Mama said, "Don't go near that river,
       Don't be hanging around old Catfish John."
       Come in the morning I'd always be there,
       Walking in his footsteps in the sweet Delta dawn.

       Born a slave in the town of Vicksburg, traded for a chestnut mare,
       Lord her never spoke in anger though his load was hard to bear.

       Mama said, "Don't go near that river,
       Don't be hanging around old Catfish John."
       Come in the morning I'd always be there,
       Walking in his footsteps in the sweet Delta dawn.
       Walking in his footsteps in the sweet Delta dawn.


       Cats Under the Stars  [Garcia/Hunter]

       Cats on the blacktop, birdie in the treetop,
       Someone plays guitar that sounds like clarinet.
       I ain't ready yet, to go to bed,
       I think I'll take a walk downtown instead.

       Cats on the bandstand, Give'em each a big hand,
       Anyone who sweats like that must be all right.
       No one wants to fight; no blackeye,
       Just another cat beneath the stars tonight.

       Cats in the limelight, feels like it's alright,
       Everybody wants something they might not get.
       I ain' ready yet, it ain't complete,
       That's why I am headin' down to Alleycat Street.

       Satin blouse unbuttoning, satin blouse unbuttoning,
       Time is a stripper's doin', it's just for you.
       Time is a stripper's doin', it's just for you.

       Knock in the brass tacks, cover up your tracks Jack,
       You ain't nowhere till you can pay your own way back.
       What else do you lack to make it right,
       But cats down under the stars tonight.


       Caution (Do Not Stop On The Tracks)  [McKernan]

       I went down one day, I went down one day to see a Gypsy woman,
       Just one old day, yes I did,
       I want to find out, I want to find out,
       I want to find out, I want to find out now,
       What's wring with me and my baby.
       We ain't gettin' down like we used to do,
       I mean it's pretty good now, but there was a time,
       When it didn't work too well.

       I went down to see this Gypsy woman, you understand,
       I told her my story, I told her what was goin' on.
       And she told me, man she said, all you need, all you need,
       She said all you got to have, oh Lord,
       Just a touch of Mojo's hand, oh bring it back on,
       And it feels pretty good, yes indeed.

       I'm goin' away now baby and I won't be back till fall,
       Just might find me a good girl might not be commin' back at all.

       Well now C., C. C. Rider, see now the moon is shining bright,
       Well now C., C. C. Rider, see now the moon is shining bright,
       Just might find me that good girl and everything would be alright.

 
       Childhood's End [Phil Lesh]
 
       When I was hoppin' freights and makin' payments on the farm
       Here between the angels and the deep blue sea
       You were runnin', laughin', growin' sheltered from the storm
       Dreamin' of the day the moon would set you free
       Yeah, to sing your siren song so sweet and warm

       River run deep
       River run slow
       Get a little restless
       Wanna see some whales blow
       River run cold
       River run clear
       That feeling always gets to me
       'Round about this time of year

       Scoutin' unknown borders under multi-colored moons
       In the wildest flights of cosmic mystery
       Rang a single soarin' tone that strung the sky in tune
       As the silence in my heart rose from the sea
       Aaah, to greet you in the dawn with a pale harpoon

       River run restless
       River run high
       Runnin thru a hailstorm
       Try to catch a star on the fly
       River run muddy
       River flow like tears
       Cocoon of life surroundin'  us
       Holdin all our hopes and fears

       Reach behind the wind
       Search beyond the stars
       We're the life on Mars

       When the day grows dark and scary scatterin' the light
       All the colors run away and hide behind your knees
       The same sweet thunder tumbles rollin' down the night
       Like a mothership that calls for you and me
       Come on, and drift along that sky river bright

       River run swiftly
       River run wide
       Feel like sailin
       On the morning tide
       River run golden
       River run true
       Set a course and follow
       Ooooh, the star that leads to you

       Though you may feel pure and saintly without Him walking by your side
       And when you come to make your crossing
       At the end of the pilgrim's way
       If you ever will meet your savior,
       You will surely meet him on that day.

       Now look at that cold Jordan, look at its deep water
       Look at that wide river Oh heavy mighty billows roll
       You better take Jesus with you, he's a true companion
       Oh I'm sure without him that you never will make it home

       That awful day of judgement is coming in the by and by
       We'll see our Lord descending in the glory from on high
       Oh, let us get in touch with Jesus and in the special love of God
       And maybe ever get ready when he comes on Jordan's tide

       Now look at that cold Jordan, look at its deep water
       Look at that wide river Oh heavy mighty billows roll
       You better take Jesus with you, he's a true companion
       Oh I'm sure without him that you never will make it home

       Now what you gonna do, Oh what you gonna say
       Oh how you gonna feel when you come to the end of the way?

      A            E       D               Dm
       Never in my mind to cause so much pain.

       [Chorus]
       [Jam]

      A            E   Bm                  D
       From day to day   just letting it ride.
      A                E               D       Dm
       You get so far away from how it feels inside.
      A              E  Bm                       D
       You can't let go   cause you're afraid to fall,
      A                E             D             Dm
       But the day may come when you can't feel at all.

       [Chorus]


       Confusion's Prince (Mindbender)  [Lesh or Garcia]

       If only I could be less blind, if only I knew what to find
       Everywhere and all of the time, it's bending my mind
       Confusion Prince is at my door
       The crown I wear is the one he wore
       He's here to bring me down some more and bend my mind

       The friendly stranger call my name
       He only wants me for his game
       But it don't matter just the same I bend his mind
       I'll wave my flags into the sun
       I fought my wars and now they're won
       And I didn't need nobody's gun, I bend their mind


       Corrina [Bob Weir and Robert Hunter]

       Corrina.........Wake it up, baby
       Corrina.........Shake it on down
       Corrina.........Corrina
       Hog of a Sunday
       Dog of a Monday
       Get it back some day
       What'd I say?
       Movin' in closer
       Cut from a long shot
       Fade on a downbeat
       Ready or not        Corrina......[as above]

       Cruise thru a stop sign
       Loggin' up a short time
       Bird on a phone line
       Soakin' up sun
       Salt on the crowtail
       What can I do?
       I'm down by law 
       But true to you      Corrina.......  

       If, what, where, and when
       Told at the proper time
       Big black wings beat at the wind
       But they don't hardly climb
       There's a silver ocean
       Silver clouds and silver sea
       A bird on the horizon
       Silver wingin' back to me   Corrina.....

       Wake it up baby
       Shake it down easy
       Bring it back someday
       What'd I say?
       Movin' in closer
       Cut from a long shot
       Fade on a downbeat
       Ready or not       Corrina...

       Corrina/wake it up baby
       Corrina/Shake it down easy
       Corrina/Shake it on up now
       Corrina/Shake it back down  Corrina.....

       If, what, where, when and how
       don't mean a thing to me
       I would love you even if
       you flew away from me
       I'll just stand here waiting
       on the far side of the sea
       There is no fear that lovers born
       will ever fail to meet
               Corrina.....wake it up baby
               Corrina.....shake it on down
               Corrina.....corrina........



       Cosmic Charlie  [Garcia/Lesh/Hunter] (GDA)

       A                                                            G
       Cosmic Charlie how do you do? Truckin' in style along the avenue.
       A                                  G                D       A  A G D A
       Dum dee dum dee doodley doo. Go on home your mama's calling you.

       Kalico Kahlia, come tell me the news.
       Calamity's waiting for a way to get to her.
       Rosy red and electric blue I bought you a paddle for your paper canoe.

       [Bridge]
       A7  D      A7   D    A7   D   A7
       Say you'll come back when you can.
           F#m  A    D  A     Bm      A  E7
       Whenever your airplane happens to land.
       A7 D  A7   D  A7   D    A7      D     E        A           Em A C#m7-5
       Maybe I'll be back here too. It all depends on what's with you.

       Hung up waiting for a windy day; kite on ice since the 1st of February
       Mama keeps saying that the wind might blow,
       But standing here, I say, I just don't know.

       New ones comin' as the old ones go.
       Everything's moving here but much too slow now.
       A little bit quicker and we might have time,
       To say "How do you do?" before we're left behind.

       [Bridge]
         C#m F#m E    G      D  A    D
       Calliope  wail like a seaside zoo.
           C#m       Bm       A            E/G#
       The very last lately inquired about you.
            D   E  D E  A   G  D        E         B           D/F#   A
       It's really very one or two. The first you wanted, the last I knew.

       I just wonder if you shouldn't feel,
       Less concerned about the deep unreal.
       The very first word is "How do you do?"
       The last "Go home; your mama's callin' you." A G D A

               A G D A         A G D A         A G D A         A G D A
       Calling you,    calling you,    calling you,    calling you,
       A     G                D       A
       Go on home your mama's calling you.
       Go on home your mama's calling you.
       Go on home your mama's calling you.
       |A . . .|E7 . A .| [3x]

       Go on home your mama's calling you.


       Crazy Fingers  [Garcia/Hunter] (GD2)

       [Intro: |Gsus4 . . .|G . . .|]

       D         C                G
       Your rain falls like crazy fingers
       Bb               F      Fm           Gsus4 G
       Peals of fragile thunder  keeping time
            Bb       Bbm      Ebmaj7         Cm G    Gsus4 G
       Recall  the days  that still are to come some sing  blue.

       Hang your heart on laughing willow stray
       Down to the water, deep sea of love
       Beneath the sweet calm face of the sea swift undertow.

       [Bridge]
       Fm                      Ab            Eb
       Life may be sweeter for this, I don't know,
       Fm              Ab       Eb  Cm/G G7
       See how it feels  in the end.
     Ab         Ao7          Ebmaj7
       May Lady Lullaby sing plainly for you,
       Dmaj7 Dbmaj7  Db7   Dbmaj7 Gsus4 G
       Soft, strong, sweet and    true.

       Cloud hands reaching from a rainbow tapping at the window,
       Touch your hair.
       So swift and bright strange fingers of light float in air.

       Who can stop what must arrive now? Something new is waiting to be born
       Dark as the night you're still by my side; shine inside.

       [Bridge]
       Gone are the days we stopped to decide where we should go,
       We just ride.
       Gone are the broken eyes we saw through in dreams,
       Gone both dream and lie.

       [Jam on verse chords]

       [Bridge]
       Life may be sweeter for this, I don't know,
       Feels like it might be all right.
       While Lady Lullaby sings plainly through you, love still rings true.

       Midnight on a carousel ride, reaching for the gold ring down inside.
       Never could reach it, just slips away but I try. |G . . .|Gsus4 . . .|


       Cream Puff War  [Garcia] (GDA)

       No, no!  She can't take your mind and leave
       I know it's just another trick she's got up her sleeve
       I can't believe that she really wants you to die
       After all it's more than enough to pay for your lie

       Wait a minute, watch what you're doin' with your time
       All the endless ruins of the past must stay behind, yeah

       Well, can't you see that you're killing each other's soul
       Well, you're both out in the streets and you got no place to go
       Your constant battes are getting to be a bore
       So go somewhere else and continue your cream puff war


       Cruel White Water        [Robert Hunter]

       Up near the border where the cruel white water
       drowns the vagabond who sleeps too low
       me and my companion, the famous Jack Of Lanterns
       tracked the misty mountains through the snow

       I ran across the hidden chord but I could not learn the changes
       the blue Pacific called and I had to go
       there was holy on the ivy in the apparition mountains
       but the warmest bed I found was ten below

       courted lady Greensleeves, she pushed me out the window
       I landed like a feather in the trees
       took off across New Mexico and landed in the bayou
       but the catfish were too lean, and I had to blow

       don't lie for gold--no no no no!
       don't lie for love--that turns out cold
       if life depends, just get out whole...
       but don't lie for less, no no no no!

       Marie Marie, Marie Helena
       you're my amour, you're my own heart
       Marie Marie, Marie Helena
       Marie Marie, Marie Helena!

       Left a life of ease and caught that black iron steamer
       across the barren waste to your arcade
       singing 'take me to your leader' in my strangest country tenor
       but the bad I set to lay was half way made

       leftover pieces weren't exactly what I needed
       they didn't have much meaning on their own
       there was some talk of deviation, but from what was never mentioned
       so I set out to find my wrong way home

       home inside the hour, I was tuning my guitar
       where I got that sudden urge I know too well
       I finished my rendition of 'Don't Pity My Condition'
       and then looked around to find what I could sell

       You can't sell your soul! Leave that alone!
       You can't change your role Big Daddy Lowe
       Don't break your back for less than love!
       and don't trade your love for stars above!

       Marie Marie, Marie Helena
       you're my amour, you're my own heart
       Marie Marie, Marie Helena
       Marie Marie, Marie Helena!

       Caught up with Jack Of Lanterns in a town called Make It Hurt
       preaching three card monte in the Live And Let It church
       the choir was down and dirty, drawing bad and betting worse
       we left at ten past six in a padded hearse

       I might find companions in after hours taverns 
       to tell a tale or two I've never heard
       but the strangest song I know
       is what the thunder said to lightening
       and I never could recall a single word
       except...

       Up near the border where the cruel white water
       drowns the vagabond who sleeps too low
       me and my companion, the famous Jack Of Lanterns
       tracked the misty mountains through the snow

       don't lie for gold--no no no no!
       don't lie for love--that turns out cold
       if life depends, just get out whole...
       but don't lie for less--no no no no!

       Marie Marie, Marie Helena
       by firelight you steal my heart 
       Marie Marie, Marie Helena
       Marie Marie, Marie Helena!



       Cryptical Envelopment  [Garcia/Hunter] (GDA)

       The other day they waited, the sky was dark and faded,
       Solemnly they stated, "He has to die, you know he has to die."
       All the children learnin', from books that they were burnin',
       Every leaf was turnin' ; to watch him die, you know he had to die.

       The summer sun looked down on him, his mother could but frown on him,
       And all the others sound on him, but it doesn't seem to matter.

       And when the day had ended, with rainbow colors blended,
       His mind remained unbended, he had to die, you know he had to die.

       And when the day had ended, with rainbow colors blended,
       Their minds remained unbended,
       He had to die, Oh, you know he had to die.


       Cumberland Blues  [Garcia/Lesh/Hunter] (GD1)

       [Intro: G]

       G
       I can't stay much longer, Melinda; the sun is getting high.
       G

       |G . . .|. . . .|. . . .|. . . .|

       You keep me up just one more night; I can't sleep here no more.
       Little Ben clock says quarter to eight; you kept me up 'til four.
       I gotta get down, I gotta get down, Or I can't work there no more.

       [Jam on G]

       G
       A lotta poor man make a five dollar bill,
       Will keep him happy all the time.
       Some other fellow's making nothing at all, and you can hear him cry.
       C                              D
       "Can I go, Buddy, can I go down, take your shift at the mine?"

       C
       Gotta get down to the Cumberland mine;

       (Gotta get down to the Cumberland Mine)

       That's where I mainly spend my time.

      G                       C          G                       C
       Lotta poor man got the Cumberland Blues; he can't win for losing.
      C                      G            Ab A                      D
       Lotta poor man got to walk the line,   just to pay his union dues.
      C                 D                 C             Am7   G
       I don't know now, I just don't know If I'm going back again.
       I don't know now, I just don't know If I'm going back again.
       I don't know now, I just don't know If I'm going back again.

        Hey, comin' out around the world be ready for a brand new beat
        Oh, summer's here and the time is right, oh for dancing in the street
        Dancing in Chicago (dancing in the street)
        Down in New Orleans (dancing in the street)
        In New York City (dancing in the street)

        All we need is music, sweet music (sweet, sweet music)
        They'll be music everywhere (everywhere)
        They'll be laughing, singing music swinging and dancing in the street

        It doesn't matter what you wear just as long as you are there
        So come on every guy and grab a girl everywhere around the world
        They're dancing (dancing in the street) oh oh

        This is an invitation across the nation the chance for folks to meet
        There'll be swinging, swaying music playing and dancing in the street

        Philadelphia, PA now (dancing in the street)
        Baltimore and D.C. (dancing in the street)
        Can't forget them other cities (dancing in the street)


        Dark Hollow  [Bill Browning]

                   A     E         A                           D    A
        I'd rather be in some dark hollow, where the sun don't ever shine,
                      G        D          A                  E          A
        Than to be in some big city, in a small room, with a girl on my mind.

        [Chorus]
        So blow your whistle freight train. Take me far on down the track.
        I'm going away, I'm leaving today
        Well I'm goin', but I ain't comin' back.

        [Jam]

        I'd rather be in some dark hollow where the sun don't ever shine
        Than to be home alone, knowing that you're gone
        Would cause me to lose my mind.

        [Chorus]
        [Jam]

        I'd rather be in some dark hollow where the sun don't ever shine

        Dark Star  [The Dead/Hunter] (GDA)

        Dark star crashes, pouring its light into ashes.
        Reason tatters, the forces tear loose from the axis.
        Searchlight casting for faults in the clouds of delusion.
        Shall we go, you and I while we can
        Through the transitive nightfall of diamonds?

        Mirror shatters in formless reflections of matter.
        Glass hand dissolving to ice petal flowers revolving.
        Lady in velvet recedes in the nights of goodbye.
        Shall we go, you and I while we can
        Through the transitive nightfall of diamonds?


        Day Job  [Garcia/Hunter]

        Maybe you collect or maybe you pay (whether)
        Still got to work that eight hour day
        Whether you like that job or not
        You'd better keep it on ice while you're lining up your long shot

        Which is to say, hey hey, keep yer day job
        Don't give it away, keep yer day job, whatever they say
        Keep yer day job 'till your night job pays.

        Steady boys starting that eight day hour

        Days Between  [Robert Hunter and Jerry Garcia]

        There were days
        and there were days
        and there were days between
        Summer flies and August dies
        the world grows dark and mean
        Comes the shimmer of the moon
        on black infested trees
        the singing man is at his song
        the holy on their knees
        The reckless are out wrecking
        The timid plead their pleas
        No one knows much more of this
        than anyone can see      anyone can see

        There were days
        and there were days
        and there were days besides
        when phantom ships with phantom sails
        set to sea on phantom tides
        Comes the lightning of the sun
        on bright unfocused eyes
        the blue of yet another day
        a springtime wet with sighs
        a hopeful candle lingers
        in the land of lullabies
        where headless horsemen vanish
        with wild and lonely cries     lonely cries

        There were days
        and there were days
        and there were days I know
        when all we ever wanted
        was to learn and love and grow
        Once we grew into our shoes
        we told them where to go
        Walked halfway around the world
        on promise of the glow
        Stood upon a mountain top
        Walked barefoot in the snow
        Gave the best we had to give
        How much we'll never know    we'll never know

        There were days
        and there were days
        and there were days between
        polished like a golden bowl
        The finest ever seen
        Hearts of Summer held in trust
        still tender, young and green
        left on shelves collecting dust
        not knowing what they mean
        Valentines of flesh and blood
        as soft as velveteen
        hoping love would not forsake
        the days that lie between      lie between

        Desolation Row  [Dylan]

        [Intro: E A E]

                        E
        They're selling postcards of the hanging.
                A                          E
        They're painting the passports brown.
       B                                         A                    E
        The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
       E                                  A                           E
        Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance.
                    B                             A                         E
        One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
                A                           E                          A
        And the riot squad they're restless, they need somewhere to go.
       E             B                      A             E A E
        As Lady and I walk out tonight, from Desolation Row.

        Cinderella, she seems so easy
        "It takes one to know one," she smiles.
        And puts her hands in her back pockets, Bette Davis style.
        And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You Belong to Me I Believe."
        And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend,
        You Better leave."
        And the only sound that you can hear, after the ambulances go,
        Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.

        Now the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide.
        The fortune telling lady, has already taken all her things inside.
        All except for Cain and Abel, and the hunchback of Notre Dame.
        Everybody is either making love, or else expecting rain.
        And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing he's getting ready for the show
        He's going down to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.

        Now Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid.
        On her twenty-second birthday, she already is an old maid.
        To her, death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest.
        Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
        And though her gaze is fixed upon, Noah's great rainbow.
        She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.

        Einstein disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
        Passed this way an hour ago, with his friend, a jealous monk.
        He looked so immaculately frightful, as he bummed a cigarette,
        And he went off sniffing drainpipes, and reciting the alphabet.
        Now you would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago,
        For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.

        [Jam]

        Dr. Filth, he keeps his world, inside of a leather cup.
        But all his sexless patients, they're all trying to blow it up.
        And his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole.
        And she also keeps the cards that read, "Have Mercy on His Soul".
        They all play on the penny whistles, you can hear then blow,
        If you lean your head out far enough on Desolation Row.

        Across the street, they've nailed the curtains.
        They're getting ready for the feast.
        The Phantom of the Opera, the pefect image of a priest.
        They're spoon-feeding Cassanova, to get him to feel more assured.
        Then they'll kill him with self-confidence,
        After poisoning him with words.
        And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls,
        "Get outta here if you don't know."
        Cassanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row.

        Now at midnight all the agents, and the super-human crew,
        Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
        Then they take them to the factory, where the heart-attack machine,
        Is strapped across their shoulders. And then the kerosene
        Is brought down from the castles, by insurance men who go,
        Check to see that nobody's escaping to Desolation Row.

        [Jam]

        Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn.
        And everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
        And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot, fighting in the captain's tower.
        While calypso singers laugh at them, and fishermen hold flowers.
        Between the windows of the sea, where lovely mermaids flow.
        And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.

        Yes I received your letter yesterday,
        About the time the doorknob broke.
        When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
        All these people that you mention, yes I know them they're quite lame
        I had to rearrange their faces, and give them all another name.
        Right now, I can't read too good, don't send no more letters no.
        Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.

        [Jam]

        In the timbers of Fennario, the wolves are running round,
                                                                   G
        The winter was so hard and cold, froze ten feet 'neath the ground.

        Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me.

        I sat down to my supper, 'twas a bottle of red whiskey,
                                                      C         B   Bb Am
        I said my prayers and went to bed, that's the last they saw of me.
                     G  F         C          Bb     F

             Am           G              C       Bb        F
        When I awoke, the Dire Wolf, six hundred pounds of sin,
                                                           G
        Was grinning at my window, all I said was "Come on in".
                     F  G         C          E7     Am
        Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me.
       G    F                C
        Please, don't murder me.

        [Bridge]
        The Wolf came in, I got my cards, we sat down for a game.
        I cut my deck to the Queen of Spades,
        But the cards were all the same.
        Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me.
        Please, don't murder me.

        [Jam on verse chords]

        In the backwash of Fennario, the black and bloody mire,
        The Dire Wolf collects his dues, while the boys sing 'round the fire.
                     F  G         C          Bb     F
        Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me.
       G    F                C
        Please, don't murder me.
                     G  F         C          E7     Am
        Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me.

        Take my line, go fishin' for a Tuesday,
        Maybe take my supper, eat it down by the sea.
        Gave my babe twenty or forty good reasons,
        Couldn't find any better ones in the morning at three.

        The rain gonna come,  but the rain gonna go y'know.
        Steppin' off sharply from the rank and file.
        Awful cold and dark like a dungeon
        Maybe get a little bit darker before the day.

        Don't Need Love  [Mydland]

        I don't need love anymore, I don't need love anymore,
        I don't need anyone to tell me that I do
        I don't need love and I don't need you.

        I try and I try to make it work,
        I try and I try to make it work
        I try and I try, yeah, I won't forget, I know,
        Love gets you nowhere slow.

        I want no more heartaches, no more goodbyes
        Ain't no more real good love, only new love, but old love dies.

        Ain't worth the time that it takes,
        Ain't worth the time that it takes,
        Ain't worth the endless hours of changes I go through,
        I don't need love and I don't need you.

        I don't need love anymore, I don't need love anymore,
        I don't need anyone to tell me that I do
        I don't need love and I don't need you.


        Don't Think Twice, It's All Right  [Dylan]

        It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
        It don't matter, anyhow,
        An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
        If you don't know by now
        When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
        Look out your window and Ill be gone,
        You're the reason I'm travelin' on,
        Don't think twice, it's all right.

        It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe,
        That light I never knowed,
        An' it ain't no use in turnin, on your light, babe,
        I'm on the dark side of the road
        Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
        To try and make me change my mind and stay.
        We never did too much talkin' anyway.
        So don't think twice, it's all right.

        It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal,
        Like you never did before,
        It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal,
        I can't hear you anymore,
        I'm a-thinkin' and a-wonderin' all the way down the road.
        I once loved a woman, a child I'm told.
        I give her my heart but she wanted my soul,
        But don't think twice, it's all right.

        I'm walking down that long, lonesome, road, babe,
        Where I'm bound I can't tell,
        But goodbye's too good a word, gal,
        So I'll just say fare thee well.
        I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind,
        You could have done better but I don't mind,
        You just kinda wasted my precious time,
        But don't think twice, It's all right.


        Drink Up and Go Home  [?]

        You sit there in crying, braiding your hair,
        You say you got trouble, my friend has a fair,
        Don't tell me your troubles, I got enough of my own,
        Be thankful for living, drink up and go home.

        Now there is still some blind man, blind he can't see,
        You think he's complaining, why should you appeal?
        Don't tell me your troubles, I got enough of my own,
        Be thankful for living, drink up and go home.


        Dupree's Diamond Blues  [Garica/Lesh/Hunter]

        D7                Gm
        When I was just a little young boy,
        C                       F
        Papa said, "Son, you'll never get far,
             D7                      Gm
        I'll tell you the reason, if you wanna know,
               C                    Bb           Bbm  C7     F
        'Cause child of mine, there isn't really very far to go."

        Well, baby, baby wants a gold diamond ring,
        Wants it more than most any old thing.
        Well, when I get those jelly roll blues,
        Why, I'd go and get anything in this world for you.

        And down to the jewelry store packin' a gun,
        Says, "Wrap it up I think I'll take this one."
        "A thousand dollars, please," the jewelry man said.
        Dupree said, "I'll pay this one off to you in lead."

        [Bridge]
        F                           C     Bb F
        Well you know son, you just can't figure.
        C               Gm                   F    C    Bb  G7
        First thing you know you're gonna to pull that trigger,
        F                        C           D7
        And it's no wonder, your reason goes bad.
        Gm              C               F
        Jelly roll will drive you stone mad.

        Judge said, "Son, it's gonna cost you some time."
        Dupree said, "Judge, you know that crossed my mind."
        Judge said, "In fact, it's gonna cost you your life."
        Dupree said, "Judge, you know, that seems to me to be about right."

        Well, baby, baby you gonna lose her sweet man.
        Dupree come out with a losin' hand.
        Baby's gonna weave it up for a while,
        Then go out and find another sweet man's gonna cheat her with style.

        Judge said, "Son, I know your baby well,
        But not to say to her that I can never tell."
        Dupree said, "Judge, well, it's well understood,
        And you got to admit that sweet, sweet Jelly's so good."

        [Bridge]

        Same old story, and I know it's been told.
        Some like jelly jelly, some like gold.
        Many a man's done a terrible thing
        Just to get baby a shiny diamond ring.


        Early Morning Rain  [G.Lightfoot]

        In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
        With an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand
        I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so
        In the early morning rain with no place to go

        Out on runway number nine big 707 set to go
        But I'm stuck here on the grass where the cold winds they do blow
        And where whiskey was and bars and the women they were fine
        There she goes my friend, she rolling down at last

        Here the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high
        She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly
        There the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines
        She'll be flying over my home in about three hours time

        This old airport's got me down it ain't no earthy good to me
        Because I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I can be
        You can't hop a jet plane like you can a railroad train
        So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain


        Easy To Love You  [Mydland/Barlow]

        Good, good morning, so good to see you weren't just a dream of mine
        Real as a raven, real as thunder, real as the sun shinin'
        But still so very undefined
        Can't imagine what's behind those sleepy eyes

        Little stranger, don't try to hide now
        You look so young when you're afraid
        There is no danger, but from the devil
        He may want you, but I'm in his way

        You don't know how easy it is
        You don't know how easy it is to love you

        And come the moonrise when the dew falls
        Don't be the sun that fades away
        Don't leave me darkness, she's no lover, she hides the day

        Ballin' that jack and drinkin' my wine.

        I been chippin' them rocks from dawn till doom
        While my rider hide my bottle in the other room.
        Doctor say better stop ballin' that jack,
        If I live five years I gonna bust my back, yes I will. |A7 . . .|

        Gotta find a woman be good to me,
        Won't hide my liquor, try to serve me tea.
        'Cause I'm a stone jack baller and my heart is true
        And I'll give everything that I got to you, yes I will.

        [Chorus]
        Easy wind going cross the Bayou today.
        There's a whole lotta women
        Out on the streets in red today;
        And the river keeps a-talkin',
        But you never heard a word it said.


        The Eleven  [Lesh/Hunter]

        High green chilly winds and windy vines
        In loops around the twined shafts of lavender,
        They're crawling to the sun.

        Underfoot the ground is patched
        With climbing arms of ivy wrapped around the manzanita,
        Stark and shiny in the breeze.

        Wonder who will water all the children of the garden
        When they sigh about the barren lack of rain and
        Droop so hungry 'neath the sky.

        William Tell has stretched his bow till it won't stretch
        No furthermore and/or it may require a change
        That hasn't come before.

        No more time to tell how, this is the season of what,
        Now is the time of returning with our thought
        Jewels polished and gleaming.
        Now is the time past believing the child has relinquished the rein,
        Now is the test of the boomerang tossed in the night of redeeming.

        Eight sided whispering hallelujah hatrack,
        Seven faced marble eyed transitory dream doll,
        Six proud walkers on the jingle bell rainbow,
        Five men writing with fingers of gold,
        Four men tracking down the great white sperm whale,
        Three girls waiting in a foreign dominion
        Riding in the whalebelly, fade away in moonlight,
        Sink beneath the waters to the coral sands below.


        El Paso  [Marty Robbins]

        D                     G
        Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
        A                             D
        I fell in love with a Mexican girl.
        D                          G
        Nighttime would find me in Rose's Cantina,
        A                                 D
        Music would play and Felina would whirl.

        D                           G
        Black as the night were the eyes of Felina,
        A                               D
        Wicked and evil while casting a spell.
        D                           G
        My love was strong for this Mexican maiden,
        A                                  D    D7
        I was in love, but in vain I could tell.

        G                                                             D
        One night a wild young cowboy came in, wild as the West Texas wind.
        D
        Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing,
                                            G           A
        With wicked Felina, the girl that I love, so in anger

        I challenged his right for the love of this maiden;
        Down went his hand for the gun that he wore.
        My challenge was answered, in less than a heartbeat
        The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor.

        Just for a moment I stood there in silence,
        Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done.
        Many thoughts ran through my mind as I stood there;
        I had but one chance and that was to run.

        [Bridge]
        Out through the back door of Rose's I ran,
        Out where the horses were tied.
        I picked a good one; he looked like he could run,
        Up on his back and away I did ride, just as fast as I

        Could from the West Texas town of El Paso,
        Out thru the badlands of New Mexico.
        Back in El Paso my life would be worthless;
        Everything's gone in life nothing is left.

        [Jam]

        But it's been so long since I've seen the young maiden,
        My love is stronger that my fear of death.

        [Bridge]
        I saddled up and away I did go, riding alone in the dark.
        Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me,
        Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart, & as last here I

        Am on the hill overlooking El Paso,
        I can see Rose's Cantina below.
        My love is strong and it pushes me onward,
        Down off the hill to Felina I go.

        Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys,
        Off to my left ride a dozen or more.
        Shouting and shooting; I can't let them catch me,
        I've got to make it to Rose's back door.

        [Bridge]
        Something is dreadfully wrong for I a feel
        A deep burning pain in my side.
        It's getting harder to stay in the saddle.
        I'm getting weary, unable to ride, but my love for

        Felina is strong and I rise where I've fallen;
        Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest.
        I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle,
        I feel the bullet go deep in my chest.

        From out of nowhere, Felina has found me,
        Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side.
        Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for,
        One little kiss and Felina goodbye.


        Empty Pages  [?]

        Empty pages before my eyes, you not deny or criticize
        Empty bedrooms where I paid my dues
        Watching the ceiling instead of you
        Can you tell me where you're goin', can't hold on to hear my song
        I've got some songs I'd love to sing
        Always bring down some other thing
        Where can I go my hands are broken
        It seems like your love is just a token, why won't you stay with me?

        Up in the morning and out the door
        She won't come in I gotta live alone
        Back in the evening with the darn poor fool out
        I got on mind just this gal, just this gal.

        Eternity [Bob Weir and Willie Dixon]

        I'm lookin' out my window
        Watch the clouds go by 
        I look to see eternity
        The endless rolling sky                         

        You cannot think of eternity
        Thinkin' it like time
        You try to think, you try to count
        You just mess up your mind

        Eternity, eternity

        Baby, I love you, you love me
        Let's love each other through eternity

        Since before man could see
        There was eternity
        After man is come and gone
        Eternity lingers on, eternity lingers on

        Everything crawl, creep, or fly
        Just live until they die
        I love you, you love me
        Let's love each other through eternity

        Eternity, eternity                    

        I love you, you love me
        Let's love each other through eternity
        Through eternity                   

        Well I think about life, we don't know
        Whether it all could be in vain
        Look through time, it's for sure
        It's the greatest gift to man

        Music and Love, you can't explain
        Try and understand
        The greatest thing could ever be
        We make love through eternity 

        Eternity, eternity

        When the world (be all it be?)
        Think that we are gone
        We'll still have our place in peace   
        Our love will linger on, linger on

        We won't care just what (who say?)
        If it's truth or lie
        We'll still have our greatest gift
        Love won't ever die
        Love won't ever die 
        No, never die
        Love won't ever die
        Never, never
        Never die

        Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home,
     C#m                    B
        Wond'rin' where the nut-thatch winters,
       D             A          E           A     E    A C
        Wings a mile long, just carried the bird away.

        G                        C                       G      C

        The heart has it's beaches it's homeland and thoughts of it's own.
        D                       C                         G              C
        Wake now, discover that you are the song that the mornin' brings,
                G                            C                C#        D
        But the heart has it's seasons, it's evenin's and songs of it's own.

        Bm A  [Jam: |Emaj7 . . .|. . . .|Bm . . .|. . . .|]

              Emaj7                 A                    Emaj7  Bm A
        There comes a redeemer, and he slowly too fades away,
                  Emaj7               A                           Emaj7  Bm A
        And there follows his wagon behind him that's loaded with clay.
                A                          C#m                     B A
        And the seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay,
            E                         A                         E   A C
        And night comes so quiet, its close on the heels of the day.

        [Chorus]
        Bm A  [Jam: |Emaj7 . . .|. . . .|Bm . . .|. . . .|]

        Sometimes we live no particular way but our own,
        And sometimes we visit your country and live in your home,
        Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone,
        Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own.

        Far From Me  [Mydland]

        You say you want to try again, wear it down between the lines
        Well, I have a better end in mind it doesn't seem to really have you
        Close your eyes to see though I know you don't mean to be
        You are so far from me

        There was something I had caught inside screaming hard to make it go
        And tied me down low, it doesn't seem you really have to
        Close you eyes to see, you've been all you'll be to me
        Though I know you don't mean to be, it's just too late
        And we can't relate at all

        This is the last time I wanna say so long
        This song is my last song for you
        There's just nothing here to hold on to
        Baby, nothing to hold on to

       Fever  [Davenport/Cooley]

       Never know how much I love you, never know how much I care.
       When you put your arms around me I get a fever that's so hard to break
       Give me fever. Fever when you hold me tight.
       Fever in the morning, fever all through the night.

       The sun lights up the day, the moon lights up the night.
       I light up when you call me name cause I know you gonna treat me right
       Fever, fever, give me kisses, fever when you hold me tight.
       Fever, in the morning, fever all through the night.

       Fever, crazy like the fever, that is something you all know.
       Fever isn't such a new thing, fever started long ago.
       Captain Smith like Pokahannis, in the very mad affair.
       When her daddy tried to kill her, she said, "Daddy, oh don't you dare"
       You give me fever, fever when you hold me tight.
       Fever, in the morning, fever all through the night.

       Romeo love Juliet, Juliet she failed to save.
       When he put his arms around her he said "Julie better hold on t'faith"
       Fever, fever with our kisses, fever with our planning, fever.
       I'm a wide duck, the fever in my mind was you.

       Now, you listen to my story, here's the point that I have made.
       Chicks are born to give you fever, get bear hives then they break.
       They give you fever with their kisses, fever when they hold you tight.
       Fever, in the morning, fever all through the night.

       B                                    A
        Takes a whole pail of water just to cool him down.

        [Chorus]
        B                 A
        Fire, fire on the mountain. 4x

        Almost ablaze, still you don't feel the heat.
        It takes all you got just to stay on the beat.
        You say it's a livin'; we all gotta eat.
        But you're here alone; there's no one to compete.
        If Mercy's in bus'ness, I wish it for you.
        More than just ashes when your dreams come true.

        [Chorus]
        [Jam]

        Long distance runner, what you holdin' out for?
        Caught in slow motion in a dash to the door.
        The flame from your stage has now spread to the floor.
        You gave all you had. Why you want to give more?
        The more that you give, the more it will take
        To the thin line beyond which you really can't fake.

        [Chorus]


        Foolish Heart  [Garcia/Hunter]

        [Intro: |A . . .|D . . .| (repeat) ]

        Bm              D                           F#m
        Carve your name, carve your name in ice and wind.
        Bm               D                            A
        Search for where, search for where the rivers end
           E                D
        Or where the rivers start.
           E                            F#m
        Do everything that's in you you feel to be your part,
            Bm              Bm7/A           Gmaj7
        But never give your love, my friend,
                       D                    |A . . .|D . . .|
        Unto a foolish heart, unto a foolish heart.

        Dare to leap, leap from ledges high and wild.
        Learn to speak, speak with wisdom like a child
        Directly to the heart.
        Crown yourself the king of clowns, or stand way back apart,
        But never give your love, my friend,
        Unto a foolish heart, unto a foolish heart.

        Shun a friend, shun a brother and a friend.
        Never look, never look around the bend,
        Or check the weather charts.
        Sign the Mona Lisa with a spray can, call it art,
        But never give your love, my friend,
        Unto a foolish heart, unto a foolish heart.

        [Bridge]
    A#    Bsus4              B              Bsus4             B
        A foolish heart will call on you to toss your dreams away.
             Bsus4/A            B/A                Bsus4/A           B/A
        Then turn    around and blame you, for the way     you went astray.
          G#m                                   C#m7-5
        A foolish heart will cost you sleep and often  make you curse.
          F#7sus4          F#7            F#7sus4          F#7-9
        A selfish heart is trouble, but a foolish heart is worse.

        |D/E . . .|E . . .| 8x

        Bite the hand, bite the hand that bakes your bread.
        Dare to leap where the angles fear to tread,
        Till you are torn apart.
        Stoke the fires of Paradise, with coals from Hell to start,
        But never give your love, my friend,
        Unto a foolish heart, unto a foolish heart.
        Unto a foolish heart, unto a foolish heart.


        Forever Young  [Dylan]

        May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true.
        May you always do for others and let others do for you.
        May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
        May you stay forever young.

        Forever young, forever young, may you stay forever young.

        May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true.
        May you always know the truth and see the lights surrounding you.
        May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong.
        May you stay forever young.

        Forever young, forever young, may you stay forever young.

        May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift.
        May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
        May your heart always be joyful, may your songs always be sung.
        May you stay forever young.

        Forever young, forever young, may you stay forever young.


        France  [Hart/Weir/Hunter] (GDA)

        Way down in the south of France all the ladies love to dance
        Kick their heels up in the air snap their fingers for romance

        While the gentlemen compare blonde or black or auburn hair
        Check the motion and the style Oh, you know they take their while

        Hey, to make the motion more complete, yeah, to make it more a treat
        Club D'Jour is where to go come on down and see the show

        When the rhythm's really right you can burn it down tonight
        When the singing's really fine sweet as Spanish sherry wine

        When the club can't contain the beat it just rolls out in the street
        Spills on down the avenue bringing dancers to their feet.

        When it's good as it can be it gets better wait and see
        Oh, these folks don't ever sleep
        Till they're passed out in the street

        Way down in the south of France all the ladies love to dance
        Clap their hands and walk on air, yeah, the feeling's really there
        Won't you take a little taste raise it to your charming face?

        When the rhythm's really right you can burn it down tonight
        When the singing's really fine sweet as Spanish sherry wine

        Go on take a chance, the ladies do love to dance.


        Franklin's Tower  [Garcia/Kreutzmann/Hunter] (GDA,GD2)

        In another time's forgotten space
        Your eyes looked from your mother's face
        Wallflower seed on the sand and stone
        May the four winds blow you safely home.

        Roll away the dew
        Roll away the dew
        Roll away the dew
        Roll away the dew

        I'll tell you where the four winds dwell
        In Franklin's tower there hangs a bell
        It can ring, turn night to day
        It can ring like fire when you lose your way.

        Roll away the dew
        Roll away the dew
        Roll away the dew
        Roll away the dew

        God save the child that rings that bell
        It may have one good ring, baby, you can't tell
        One watch by night, one watch by day
        If you get confused listen to the music play.

        [jam]

        Some come to laugh their past away
        Some come to make it just one more day
        Whichever way your pleasure tends
        If you plant ice you're gonna harvest the wind.

        Roll away the dew
        Roll away the dew
        Roll away the dew
        Roll away the dew

        In Franklin's tower the four winds sleep
        Like four lean hounds the lighthouse keep
        Wildflower seed on the sand and wind
        May the four winds blow you home again.

        Roll away the dew
        Roll away the dew
        Roll away the dew
        You'd better roll away the dew

        Roll away the dew
        Roll away the dew
        Roll away the dew
        You'd better roll away the dew - roll away.


        Friend of the Devil  [Garcia/Dawson/Hunter] (GDA,GD1)

        G                          C
        I lit out from Reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds.
        G                                        C
        Didn't get to sleep that night 'till the morning came around.

        [Chorus]
        D
        Set out runnin' but I take my time,
          Am
        A friend of the devil is a friend of mine.
           D                             Am                          D
        If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight.

        Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
        I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills.

        [Chorus]

        I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there.
        He took my twenty dollar bill and he vanished in the air.

        [Chorus]

        [Bridge]
        D
        Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night.
            C
        The first one's named Sweet Anne Marie and she's my hearts delight.
        D
        Second one is prison, baby, the sheriff's on my trail,
            Am                         C                D
        And if he catches up with me I spend my life in jail.

        Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee.
        The first one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me.

        [Chorus]

        [Jam: |G . . . |C . . . |G . . . |C . . . |
              |D . . . |Am. . . |D . . . |Am . . .|D . . . |D . . . | ]

        [Bridge]

        Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee.
        The first one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me.

        [Chorus]

        --------

        [Robert Hunter's additional verse:]
          You can borrow from the devil, you can borrow from a friend.
          The devil give you twenty, when your friend got only ten.


        From the Heart of Me  [D.Godchaux]

        Voices slide down off the mountain, sunlight turning red
        Falls on the earth and it spreads
        Even the families lower their heads as they ride

        Age old faces of the mountains looming naturally
        I wonder if they're looking at me, their monumental eyes I can feel

        In the glow of the twilight the thought of home
        Reminds me now I'm reaching out to you
        Anything I can do to be safe and warm in your arms

        All I have from the heart of you

        I'd meet you anywhere in the country or anywhere on the sea
        All over the world it could be
        I would follow you with the heart of me

        Love calls echo in the valley, dream come true tonight
        Remembering you hold me tight in tomorrow morning's light
        I will find you

        When I awoke the stars were out and shining, shining for you and me
        All I ever wanna be is save and warm in your arms
        All I have, from the heart of me

        Gentlemen, Start Your Engines  [Mydland/Barlow]

        It's three AM in the combat zone.
        Gentlemen start your engines!
        They can close this bar, but baby I ain't goin.
        Gentlemen start your engines!
        If you lock up the whiskey, give me gasoline.
        I got a seven grand redline on the black machine.
        The dead can do my sleepin', if you know what I mean.
        Gentlemen start your engines!
        Ge-Ge-Ge-Gentlemen start your engines!
        Gentlemen start
        Gentlemen start
        Ge-Ge-Ge-Gentlemen start your engines!

        Got a little girl here in a pinafore dress.
        Gentlemen start your engines!
        She's got more tricks than you can guess.
        Gentlemen start your engines!
        It's dark outside, but it's darker within.
        Check the back of my jacket just to see my grin.
        They don't write pomes about the state I'm in.

        I've been ridin' hell for leather,
        Put away wet and angry in the dark.

        When the police come you better let 'em in,

        Don't forget to tell 'em what a sport I've been.
        Gentlemen start your engines!
        I got a head full of vintage TNT,
        They're gonna blow me up 'stead of burying me.
        If you're lookin' for trouble come and sit with me.

        There's some mighty stormy weather
        Howlin' round the caverns of my heart.


        Get Back  [Lennon/McCartney]

        JoJo was a man who thought he was a woman,
        But he knew it couldn't last
        JoJo left his home in Tucson, Arizona for some California grass.
        Get back, get back, get back to where you once belonged
        Get back JoJO, go home, get back, get back Joe

        Sweet Loretta Molin thought she was a woman, but she was another man
        All the other girls around here said she's got it coming
        But she gets it while she can.
        Oh, get back, get back, get back to where you once belonged
        Get back, get back, get back to where you once belonged
        Get back Loretta, go home,
        Get back to where you where you once belonged

        See that girl, barefootin' along,

        Gomorrah  [Garcia/Hunter]

       E       A         E                     E/F# E/G# A
        Just a song of Gomorrah, I wonder what they did  there
        A       D/A    E                D         A  [Intro]
        Must've been a bad thing to get shot down for
        I wonder how they blew it up or if they burned it down
        Get out, get out Mr. Lot and don't you look around.

        Who gave you your orders, someone from the sky
        I heard a voice inside my head in the desert wind so dry

        [Bridge]
     G#m                                  C#m
        I heard a voice tellin' me to flee the very same voice
          E        B
        I always believe
     G#m                             F#m                            B
        Said alot of trouble's comin', but it don't have to come to you
       A                   E                          D           A       [I]
        I'm telling you so you can tell the rest what you've been through.

        Don't you turn around, no, don't look after you
        It's not your business how it's done, you're lucky to get through
        You're a good upstanding man, a credit to the flock
        But if you don't face straight ahead you could not take the shock
        Blew the city off the map, left nothing there but fire
        The wife of Lot got turned to salt, because she looked behind her.

        Good Times Blues (Never Trust A Woman)  [Mydland]

        Gonna see some good times,
        Gonna get to ring that bell.
        Gonna see some good times,
        Some times to make up for when
        I'm not feelin' that well.
        I must be due some great times,
        'Cause right now I feel like hell.

        Never trust a woman,
        Who wears her pants too tight.
        Never trust a woman,
        Who wears her pants too tight.
        She may be back tomorrow,
        She'll be gone tomorrow night.

        Come tomorrow, I'll get my pay,
        And I'm gonna leave this town,
        Come tomorrow, I'll get my pay, I'll get my pay,
        And I'm gonna leave this God damn town.
        If she don't really love me,
        There ain't no reason to stick around.

        Gonna see some good times,
        Gonna get to ring that bell.
        Gonna see some good times,
        Oh, some times to make up for when
        I'm not feelin' that well.
        Must be due some great times,
        But if they never come around,
        Oh, oh what the, if they never, come around,
        Never, never ever, ever, ever, come around,
        Oh, what the hell.

        Greatest Story Ever Told  [Weir/Hart/Hunter]

        C              F    C            F C
        Moses come ridin' up on a quasar.
            C                  F      C             F C
        His spurs was a-jingling, the door was ajar.
            C                F     C               F C

        And I asked him to come on in  out of the cold.

            Am        E?           C                F C
        His brain was boiling, his reason was spent.
        Am         E?        C               F C
        Nothing is borrowed, nothing is lent.
          C                  F    C             F C

        Green, Green Grass of Home  [C.Putman]

        The old home town looks the same as I step off the train
        Meeting every train in my mind's eye till the man in mail came
        Hair like gold, lips like cherry
        It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
        Green, green grass of home, green green grass of home.

        Only dream I know of is to be found hair like gold,
        Lips like a cherry
        It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
        They'll all come to greet me, on the steps of my sweet dream
        It's good I dreamt the green, green grass of home
        I wait and look around me at the broken walls that surround me
        And out here I was on the ground.

        There's a garden in the path of progress
        Unharmed through winter's day break
        Then I'll touch the green, green grass of home
        They'll all come to greet me from the chains of the old dark hollow

        The green, green grass of home
        They'll all come to greet me on the steps, my sweet dream


        The Harder They Come  [J.Cliff]

        Well they tell me of a pie up in the sky
        Waiting for me when I die
        But between the day you're born and when you die
        They never seem to hear you even your cry.

        So as sure as the sun will shine
        I'm gonna get my share now, what's mine
        And the harder they come, the harder they fall
        The harder they come, the harder they fall one and all.

        Well the oppressors are trying to keep me down
        Trying to drive me underground
        And they think that they have got the battle won
        I say forgive them Lord they know not what they've done.

        Cause as sure as the sun will shine
        I'm gonna get my share now, what's mine
        And the harder they come, the harder they fall
        The harder they come, the harder they fall one and all.

        And I'll keep on fighting for the things I want
        Though I know that when you're dead you can't
        But I'd rather be a free man in my grave
        Than living as a puppet or a slave.

        So as sure as the sun will shine
        I'm gonna get my share now, what's mine
        And the harder they come, the harder they fall
        The harder they come, the harder they fall one and all.

        [Intro]

        Anything you could want to be you can buy, even get it free
        Make yourself a smoother dancer, fill your head with easy answers.
        Never a backward glancer, it's you who makes the rules (aah).

        Heaven help the fool, heaven help the fool
        No, no, never a backward glancer, (fool), heaven help the fool.

        The middle of a pentagram, heart of the star (is what you are)
        You can trade your soul for an electric guitar

        Ooh, not a pretty vanity (no, no, not me).
        Glorified insanity (no, no, not me)
        And when they offer golden apples, are you sure you'll refuse?
        Heaven help the fool, are you sure you'll refuse it?
        Heaven help the fool
        It's like a deaf man dancing or a blind man shooting pool
        Heaven help the fool, heaven help the fool

        Hell in a Bucket  [Weir/Barlow]

        Well I was drinkin' last night with a biker
        And I showed him a picture of you
        I said, "Pal get to know her, you'll like her
        Seemed like the least I could do.
        Cause when he's chargin' his chopper
        Up and down your carpeted halls
        You will think me, by contrast, quite proper
        Never mind how I stumble and fall.

        You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot
        For a taste of your elegant pride
        I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe
        But at least I'm enjoying the ride, at least I'll enjoy the ride.

        Cause you're a sweet little softcore pretender
        Somehow, babe, it got as hot as it gets
        With her black leather gold spike suspenders
        And your chain, your black whip and pets.

        Well we know you're the reincarnation
        Of the revernous Catherine the Great
        And we know how you love the ovation
        And the scene that it seems to create.

        You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot
        For taste of your elegant pride
        I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe
        But at least I'm enjoying the ride, at least I'll enjoy the ride.

        You analyze me, attempt to despise me
        And you laugh when I stumble and fall
        There may come a day when I'll dance on your grave
        Unable to dance I'll still crawl across it
        Unable to dance I'll still crawl
        Unable to dance I'll still crawl
        Unable to dance I'll crawl.

        You must really consider the circus
        It just might be your kind of zoo
        I can't think of a place that's more perfect
        For a person as perfect as you.

        And it's not like I'm leaving you lonely
        Cause I wouldn't know where to begin
        Well I know you wake up here only
        When the snakes come marching in.

        You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot
        For taste of your elegant pride
        I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe
        But at least I'm enjoying the ride, at least I'll enjoy the ride.

        Ride, ride, ride
        Ride, ride, ride
        Ride, ride, ride
        At least I'm enjoyin' the ride (etc.)

        Tell me the cost; I can pay, let me go, tell me love is not lost.
        Sell everything; without love day to day insanity's king.
        I will pay (fresh) day by day (leia), anyway, lock, bolt and key.
        Crippled but free, I was blind all the time I was learning to see

        Help on the way, well, I know only this, I've got you today.
        Don't fly away, cause I love what I love and I want it that way.
        I will stay one more day, like I say, honey it's you.
        Making it too, without love in a dream it will never come true (leia)

        Henry got pissed off and said he'd run to Mexico.
        G                                 F          G
        See if he could come back holdin' 20 keys of Gold.

        Now the road to Acapulco is very hard indeed
        And it isn't any better if you haven't any weed.
        Henry struggled to hold it straight on twisty mountain roads
        Fifty people waitin' back in hopes for Henry's load.

        Henry got to Mexico and turned his truck around.
        Talkin' with the man who has it growin' from the ground.
        Henry tasted, he got wasted, couldn't even see.
        Now how he's going to drive like that it's not clear to me.

        Sunday afternoon, Tihajuana is a lovely town.
        Bullfight brings the tourist in, their money flowing down.
        Border guards are much too busy there at 5 o'clock.
        Henry truckin' right on through, he hardly even stopped.

        Hurts Me Too  [E.James/M.Sehorn]

        You said you was hurtin', almost lost your mind;
        'Cause the man you love, hurts you all the time.
        But when things go wrong, wrong with you... it hurts me too.

        You love him a little more, when you ought to love him less.
        Why pick up behind him and take his best?
        'Cause when things go wrong, wrong with you...  it hurts me too.

        You love another man; Oh, but I love you
        But you love him darlin', stick to him just about like glue.
        But when things go wrong, wrong with you... it hurts me too.

        Well, he better leave you, or you best put him down.
        'Cause you know, I just can't stand to see, see you pushed around.
        'Cause when things go wrong, wrong with you...  it hurts me too.


        I Believe  [?]

        I don't feel like I can, I don't feel like I can
        But if anybody hears this sermon I want you to know
        I want you to know that I had tried to save my business true
        I just couldn't handle 'cause the devil's got into my bones
        'Cause the devil's in everybody's bones
        Well the devil's in my bones, in your bones, in his bones
        And you can't do right all the time.
        If you try you gonna die someplace
        You gonna die someplace lonely

        You got nothing to keep it cool, I got one thing to say
        I believe, I believe, I got to believe in, but I'm done
        And you know that I;m believin' Oh Lord
        I believe in everything standing for I believe in my woman too
        I believe in my woman more than you my Lord

        If I Had The World To Give  [Garcia/Hunter] (GDA)

        If I had the world to give, I'd give it to you
        Long as you live, would you let it fall, or hold it all in your arms?

        If I had a song to sing, I'd sing it to you
        As long as you live, lullaby or maybe a plain serenade
        Wouldn't you laugh, dance, and cry or be afraid
        At the change you made

        I may not have the world to give to you
        But maybe I have a tune or two
        Only if you let me be your world
        Could I ever give this world to you

        But I will give what love I have to give,
        I will give what love I have to give,
        I will give what love I have to give, long as I live.

        If I had a star to give, I'd give it to you
        Long as you live, would you have the time
        To watch it shine, watch it shine
        Or ask for the moon and heaven too? I'd give it to you.

        Well maybe I've got no star to spare, or anything fine or even rare,
        Only if you let me be your world,
        Could I ever give this world to you.
        Could I ever give this world to you.



        If The Shoe Fits   [Phil Lesh and Andrew Charles]
 
 
        Will your high hopes get you there
        Goal so far and yet so near
        You can't ignore the writing on the wall
        Every time you rise you fall
        End nowhere in sight at all
        Why should you pick it up and try again
 
 
        Chorus:
        Give it up, 'cause you can't win
        Let it go while you still can
        Gave it all you had, now you're feelin' bad
        So you're gone, ready to roam
        You come on so strong with that same sad song
        Wherever you go
        Run along, take your ball and go home
 
 
        Promised yet another chance
        Forbidden just a single glance
        So much rides on what you say and do
        Discarded truths and famous myths
        Tales that life deceives you with
        Certain things you always thought you knew
       
        Chorus
 
        Helpful hands that pull you down
        Smaller minds turn you around
        Friends in need are never really true
        Why should you put trust in this
        Bridge above the dark abyss
        You never learned you can't make all the rules
 
        Chorus
 


        I Fought The Law   [Sonny Curtis]

        Breakin' rocks in the hot sun
        I fought the law and the law won (twice)
 
        I needed money 'cause I had none 
        I fought the law and the law won (twice)
 
        Chorus:
        I left my baby and it feels so bad
        Guess my race is run
        She the best that I ever had
        I fought the law and the law won (twice)

        Solo, and repeat chorus.

        I'll Be With Thee  [?]

        Just like the prodigal son, when he was far from home.
        He wanted to go back & tell his father he had done wrong.
        He fell on his knees, oh Lord, answer this please, & said,
        "If you go back home I'll go with thee."
        Just like the Israelites, who were Pharaoh's slaves.
        They suffered in bondage & they prayed for days.
        The Lord said, "Moses, go set them free."
        I am the Lord, by God, & I'll go with thee.
        Just like oh Joshua, Jericho, Jericho walls, he wanted to overthrow.
        The Lord said, "Fight, & I'll give you victory."
        I am the Lord by God, & I'll go with thee.
        He said, "I'll be with thee, whenever you're in trouble."
        "I'll be with thee, you don't have to worry."
        "I'll be with thee, 'cause the power's in my hands."
        "I'll be with thee, through the water, through the flood, through
        The fire, through the blood."
        I am the Lord, by God, & I'll be with thee, I'll be with thee.
        Here him saying, "I'll be with thee."
        I could hear God saying, "I'll be with thee."
        You don't have to worry, "I'll be with thee."
        You don't have to be afraid, "I'll be with thee."
        Through failure, success, I'll understand when you done your best.
        I am the Lord, by God, & I'll be with thee, I'll be with thee.

        Statuesque, raven-dressed, a goddess of the night.
        Her secret incantations, a candle burning blue
        We'll consult the spirits maybe they'll know what to do.

        And it's real and it won't go away, oh no
        I can't get around it and I can't run away
        I need a miracle every day.

        |E7 . . .|8x  |Asus5 . . .|2x  |E7 . . .|2x  |B . . .|2x
        |E7 (guitar break)|

        I need a woman 'bout twice my weight
        A ton of fun who packs a gun with all her other freight
        Find her in a sideshow, leave her in L.A.
        Ride her like a surfer, running on a tidal wave.

        And it's real, believe it today, yeah
        One thing, well I got to say, I need a miracle every day.

       B
        It takes dynamite to get me up
      E7
        Too much of everything is just enough
       B
        One more thing I just got to say
      E7
        I need a miracle every day. [key change]

      G7
        I need a miracle every day (everyday).
        I need a miracle every day (I must have a miracle).
        I need a miracle every day (some kind of miracle).
        I need a miracle, I need a miracle.
        I need a miracle every day (I need a miracle).
        I need a miracle every day (some kind of miracle).
        I need a miracle every day (got to have a miracle).
        I need a miracle, I need a miracle.

        I Saw Her Standing There  [Lennon/McCartney]

        Well she was just seventeen, you know what I mean
        And the way she looked was way beyond compare
        So how could I dance with another, oh when I saw her standing there

        Well she looked at me and I, I could see
        That before too long I'd fall in love with her
        She wouldn't dance with another, oh when I saw her standing there

        Well my heart went boom when I crossed that room
        And I held her hand in mine
        Oh we danced through the night and we held each other tight
        And before too long I fell in love with her
        Now I'll never dance with another, oh when I saw her standing there

        I Shall Be Released  [Dylan]

        [Intro: G C G]

       G                            Am
        They say every man can be replaced.
      Bm               C               G
        They say every distance is not needed.
       G                     Am   Bm         C              G
        But I remember every face   of every man who put me in.

        [Chorus]
       G                        Am     Bm         C               G
        I've seen my light come shining, from the West out to the East.
       G           Am           Bm        Am   G
        Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.

        [Jam]

        They say every man needs protection.
        They say that every man must fall.
        Yet I swear I see my reflection somewhere so high above this wall.

        [Chorus]

        Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd.
        A man who swears he's not to blame.
        All day long you hear him crying out so loud.
        Just crying out that he was framed.

        [Chorus 3x]


        It's A Man's World  [J.Brown/B.Jones]

        This is a man's world, this is a man's world
        But it wouldn't be nothing without a woman or a girl

        You know man made a car to take us over the road
        Man made the train to carry heavy loads
        Man made electric lights to take us out of the dark
        Man made a boat for the water just like Noah made the ark

        Think about a little baby girl and a little baby boy
        Man makes then happy 'cause man makes them toys
        And after man has made everything, everything in the world he can
        Man makes money to buy some other man



        It's A Sin   [Hughes]


        I know it's wrong, the things you do
        The way that I mistreated you
        But I know, oh-oh, it's a sin
        It's a sin

        My baby told me from the start
        She said darling, you're breaking my heart
        [chorus]

        My baby watched me from the side
        Then she hung her head and cried
        [chorus]



        It's No Use  [Clark/McQuinn]

        [Intro: C]

                    F
        It ain't no use, for you to cry. Woman you better, dry your eyes.
                      C               G                 C                G
        You hurt me so, I want you to know. It ain't no use, it ain't no use.

                    C
        There was a time, you was my pride and joy
                F
        Woman I love you, like a child loves his toy
                      C               G
        You hurt me so, I want you to know  [You done me wrong]
                    C                   G
        It ain't no use, it ain't no use.

        [Bridge]
       F  Em        Dm                      C
        I wanted you, you wanted someone else
      Bb                  C
        You went away and left me,
        Dm                 Em                 F                G
        Left me all by my, left me all by my, left me all by myself.

        Now it's your turn to cry, hand me your mistakes
        Woman I love you, but it's too late
        You hurt me so, I want you to know  [You done me wrong]
        It's too late, it's too late

        [Jam]
        [Repeat all verses]
        You done me wrong, you wanna come back home.
        It's too late, it's too late
        You done me wrong, you wanna come back home
        It's too late.


        It Doesn't Matter  [Brent Mydland and John Barlow]

        Finished up my masterpiece, gave it to the thought-police.
        Want a two-way ticket for a one-way ride.
        Nothing lasts nor ever will
        You get born, then you're over the hill
        Try you might, but no one's leavin' alive.

        They say what goes up will always come back down.
        Looks to me like it just goes around and around and around.

        It doesn't matter, doesn't matter.
        It's alright, it's alright.
        The universe is workin' fine tonight.
        It doesn't matter, doesn't matter.
        It's OK.
        Whatever comes to pass, will just pass right on away.

        The future is a sea of dreams
        The past a pack of lies it seems.
        Walk in glory or crawl to fame
        I only own the surrounding minute
        Borrowin' everything that's in it.
        Step out on the stage and lose your name.

        They say what goes up will always come back in
        I don't know, I just like to watch it spin and spin and spin.

        It doesn't matter, doesn't matter.
        Have a little faith.
        I burn my maps so I can navigate.
        It doesn't matter, doesn't matter.
        Have a little hope.
        You can't see tomorrow with a telescope.

        We tear down nations with fists and rages
        For a paragraph on history's pages.
        See those towers in the desert, torn in half.
        Whenever you mention Destiny,
        You better get rid of that capital D.
        Whenever Man plans, it makes God laugh.

        Where all this is heading, I can't even guess.
        I close my eyes and I just say, "yes,"
        I say, "yes, yes, yes."

        It doesn't matter, doesn't matter.
        Gotta be here now.
        Gotta learn to live in the present somehow.
        It doesn't matter, doesn't matter.
        Your big designs look mighty damned small
        In the endless halls of time.


        It Is What It Is  [Brent Mydland and John Barlow]

        It's a cobbled dance that no one planned
        Least of all the dancer, a crap shoot dream you summon
        From the corner of one eye.
        If you need an explanation, there's a quick and easy answer.
        Stop thinking for a moment and give this one a try:

        Just say: It is what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is,
        Hey, it is what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is

        It is what it is, what it might have been, it isn't.
        An infinity of mornings, and only one shines through.
        It is what it is, gonna grab the day we're given,
        'Cause it is what it is, and what it is will have to do.

        You stop waiting for the check to come, the postman's on vacation.
        Take a job that starts at midnight, give completely up on luck.
        A scientologist comes knocking, when you to battle stations,
        He says, "Wait, my name's Mark Anthony,
        And here's your million bucks."

        Oh well, it is what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is
        Hey, it is what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is,

        It is what it is, what you had in mind, it won't be
        Despite your great endeavors, the prize comes free to you.
        It is what it is, if you feel surprised, then don't be,
        'Cause it is what it is, and what it is will have to do.

        Animals eat animals, creation eats the winner.
        Fall down to the beetles, and start back up again.
        It's a long way up the chain of life, not easy for beginners.
        You'll find that it's no easier for elephants or men.

        But hey, it is what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is,
        Yeah, it is what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is,

        It is what it is, it is what it is
        What it might have been, it isn't.

        An infinity of mornings, and only one shines through.
        It is what it is, gonna grab the day we're given,
        'Cause it is what it is, and what it is will have to do.


        It Must Have Been The Roses  [Garcia/Hunter] (GDA)

        Annie laid her head down in the roses.
        She had ribbons, ribbons, ribbons, in her long brown hair.
        I don't know, maybe it was the roses,
        All I know I could not leave her there.

        I don't know, it must have been the roses,
        The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair.
        I don't know, maybe it was the roses,
        All I know I could not leave her there.

        Ten years the waves roll the ships home from the sea,
        Thinkin' well how it may blow in all good company,
        If I tell another what your own lips told to me,
        Let me lay 'neath the roses, till my eyes no longer see.

        I don't know, it must have been the roses,
        The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair.
        I don't know, maybe it was the roses,
        All I know I could not leave her there.

        One pane of glass in the window,
        No one is complaining, no, come in and shut the door,
        Faded is the crimson from the ribbons that she wore,
        And it's strange how no one comes round any more.

        I don't know, it must have been the roses,
        The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair.
        I don't know, maybe it was the roses,
        All I know I could not leave her there.

        Annie laid her head down in the roses.
        She had ribbons, ribbons, ribbons, in her long brown hair.
        I don't know, maybe it was the roses,
        All I know I could not leave her there.


        It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry  [Dylan]

        [Intro: A Asus4]

                  A              E A7    Ab7 G7 A
        I drive a mailtrain, mama, can't buy a  thrill.
        I've been up all night, mama, leanin' on the window sill
       A     G      D          E
        If I die on top of the hill
       A                   E    A7      Ab7 G7 A
        If I don't make it, you know my bab-y  will.

        Don't the moon look good, mama, shinin' through the trees?
        Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the "Double E"?
        Don't the sun look fine setting down over the sea?
        Don't my gal look fine when she's comin' after me?

        [Jam]

        Wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost.
        I tried to tell everybody, but I could not get across.
        Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
        Don't say I didn't warn you, when your train gets lost.
        Don't say I didn't warn you, when your train gets lost.
        Don't say I didn't warn you, when your train gets lost.


        I Wash My Hands  [J. Babcock]

        I wash my hands in the muddy water
        I wash my hands but they wouldn't come clean
        I wash my hands in the muddy water
        But I must have washed my hands in a muddy stream

        Well I was born in ol' Virginia
        North Carolina, I did wrong
        If I'd listen to what daddy told me
        I would not be so rude and all alone


        I Will Take You Home  [Mydland/Barlow]

        Little girl lost, in a forest of dreams.
        It's a dark old wood, and it's damp with dew.
        Hoot owl hoots, for a moment it seems
        Something big and cold got ahold of you.

        Just when everything gets scary,
        Daddy's come 'round for his darlin' again.
        Hold my hand with your little fingers.
        Daddy's loving arms gonna gather you in.

        Ain't no way the Bogeyman can get you.
        You can close your eyes, the world is gonna let you.
        Your Daddy's here and never will forget you.
        I will take you home.
        I will take you home.
        Gonna carry you back home in my arms.
        I will take you home.

        Long is the road, we must travel down.
        Short are the legs that will struggle behind.
        I wish I knew for sure, just where we're bound.
        What we will be doin', and what we're gonna find.

        Wherever we go, there will be birds to cheer you.
        Flowers to color in the fields around.
        Wherever we go, I'll be right here near you.
        You can't get lost when you're always found.

        Ain't no fog that's thick enough to hide you
        Your Daddy's gonna be right here beside you
        If your fears should start to get inside you.
        I will take you home.
        I will take you home.
        Gonna carry you back home in my arms.
        I will take you home.

              Am            C                          E
        There was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell
           Am              C             F                  C
        He had a Beautiful daughter, the truth to you we'll tell
        Am     E                  Am
        Oh the truth to you we'll tell

        She had sweethearts a plenty, and men of high degree
        But none but Jack the sailor, her true love ever be
        Oh her true love ever be

        Jackie's gone a sailing, with trouble on his mind
        He's left his native country and his darling girl behind
        Oh his darling girl behind

        She went down to a tailor shop and dressed in man's array
        She climbed on board a vessel to convey herself away
        Oh convey herself away

        Before you get on board sir, your name we'd like to know
        She smiled on her countenance, they called me Jack-A-Roe
        Oh they called me Jack-A-Roe

        I see your waist is slender, your fingers they are small
        Your cheeks too red and rosy to face the cannonball
        Oh to face the cannonball

        I know my waist's too slender, my fingers they are small
        But it would not make me tremble to see ten thousand fall
        Oh to see ten thousand fall

        The war soon being over she went and looked around
        Among the dead and wounded her darling boy she found
        Oh her darling boy she found

        She picked him up on in her arms and carried him to the town
        She sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds
        Oh to quickly heal his wounds

        This couple they got married so well they did agree
        This couple they got married so why not you and me?
        Oh why not you and me?
        Oh why not you and me?

        Leavin' Texas, fourth day out of July,
        Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky.
        Catch the Detroit Lightnin' out of Sante Fe,
        The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea.

        Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride.
        Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride.
        There ain't a place a man can hide, Shannon
        Will keep him from the sun
        Ain't a bed can give us rest now, you keep us on the run.

        Jack Straw from Wichita cut his buddy down,
        And dug for him a shallow grave and laid his body down.
        Half a mile from Tucson, by the morning light,
        One man gone and another to go,
        My old buddy you're moving much too slow.

        We can share the women, we can share the wine.


        Johnny B. Goode  [Chuck Berry]

        Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans,
        Way back in the woods among the evergreens
        There in an old cabin made of earth and wood
        There lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode.
        He never learned to read or write so well,
        But he could play a guitar like ringin' a bell.

        Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go;
        go Johnny go, go; Go Johnny go, go; Go Johnny B. Goode.

        He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack,
        Go sit up in the trees by the railroad track.
        The engineers seen him sittin' in the shade
        Strummin' to the rhythm that the drivers made.
        People passin' by would stop and say
        "My my, but that little country boy can play!"

        His mamma told him "Someday you will be a man."
        You will be the leader of a big old band
        Many people comin' from miles around
        To hear you play your music when the sun goes down.
        Maybe someday your name will be in lights.

        You're just robbing and stabbing and looting and shooting
        Now you're too bad
        You're just robbing and stabbing and looting and shooting
        Now you're too bad

        One of these days when you hear a voice say come

        There will be no rock

        Feeling so ashamed
        Hoping and praying, Lord, that she could understand me,
        but I didn't know her name
        She took my little hand in hers and she told me I was wrong
        She said "You're gonna be alright boy, whoa,
        Gonna take so long"
        Got to keep on growing, Keep on going,

        Oh, the wind blows cold, on the trail of the buffalo.
        C                  G            D                  Em

        In the land of the Navajo.

          G                              C
        A hundred miles from nowhere out on the desert sand,
       D                                                      G
        One-Eyed Jack, the trader, held some torquoise in his hand.
           G                                  C
?       He bide his sites at Running Elk, his long time indian friend,
       D                                                     G
        He vowed that he would stay by Jack until the bitter end.

        Jack had gambled everything he owned to lead this wanderin' life,
        He might've had a happy home and a tender loving wife.
        But his hunger was for trading trapper's furs for torquoise stone.
        Anything that the indians had, Jack wanted for his own.

        [Chorus]
        [Jam on chorus chords]

        Said Jack to Running Elk, "I'll gamble all my precious stones,
        Before I leave my body here among these bleachin' bones.
        But now my time is drawing near and I'm filled with dark regrets,
        My spirit longs to journey as the sun begins to set."

        "For we raped and killed, we stole your land,
        We ruled with guns and knives.
        Fed whiskey to your warriors while we stole away your wives."
        Said Running Elk, "What's done is done, you white men rule this land.
        So lay the cards face up and play your last broken-hearted hand."

        [Chorus]
        [Jam on chorus chords]

        When you're dealing cards with death, the jokers wild, the aces high,
        Jack bid the Mississippi River, Running Elk raised him the sky.
        Jack saw him with the sun and moon and upped him with the stars.
        Running Elk bet the Rocky Mountains, Jupiter, and Mars.

        The sun was sinking in the west when Jack drew the ace of spades,
        Running Elk just rolled his eyes, his smiling passed away.
        Jack picked up his torquoise stones and cast them to the sky.
        He stared into the setting sun and then made the mournful cry.

        [Chorus]

        Lazy lightnin' sleepy fire in your eyes
        It's like desire in disguise
        I keep on tryin' but I, I can't get through
        Lazy lightnin' I'd like to find the proper potion
        That's gonna capture your emotion
        You're right beside me but I, I can't get through

        You're a loop of lazy lightnin', just a loop of lazy lightnin'
        Must admit you're kinda frightnin' but you really get me high
        So exciting, when I hear your velvet thunder,
        You seem so near I start to wonder
        Would you come closer if, if I asked you to?

        So inviting, the way you're messing with my reason
        It's an exception but it's pleasing
        Tell me a lie and I will swear, I'll swear it's true.

        You're a loop of lazy lightnin' (Lazy lightnin')
        Just a loop of lazy lightnin' (Lazy lightnin')

        Just a loop of lazy lightnin'
        Put the fire in my eyes (Lightnin')
        Put the fire every time (Lightnin')
        Put the fire in my heart (Lightnin')
        Well come on lazy lightning.
        Just a loop of lazy lightning

        Misty lightning, well you always electrify me
        Someday I know you'll satisfy me
        And all that lightnin' will be my lightnin' too.
        My lightnin' too.  (My lightnin' too)
        Just a loop of lazy lightnin' (My lightnin' too)

        Lazy River Road         (Hunter/Garcia)
 
        Way down upon Sycamore Slough
        A white man sings the blues
        selling roses of paper mache
        with flecks of starlight dew
        I swiped a bunch and threw it your way
        where hazy moonlight glowed
        Way down, down along Lazy River Road
 
        Way down upon Shadowfall Ward
        End of the avenue
        Run, hide, seek in your own backyard
        Mama's backyard won't do
        All night long I sang love's sweet song
        down where the water flowed
        Way down, down along Lazy River Road
 
        Moonlight wails as hound dogs bay
        but never quite catch the tune
        Stars fall down in buckets like rain
        til there ain't no standing room
        Bright blue boxcars train by train
        clatter where dreams unfold
        Way down, down along Lazy River Road
 
        Way down upon Seminole Square
        belly of the river tide
        Call for me and I will be there
        for the price of a taxi ride
        Night double-clutches into today
        like a truck downshifting its load
        Way down, down along Lazy River Road
 
        Thread the needle
        right through the eye
        The thread that runs so true
        All the others I let pass by
        I only wanted you
        Never cared for careless love
        but how your bright eyes glowed
        Way down, down along Lazy River Road

        Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door.
      Am           C                      Am          C                 Bm D
        See the sun sparkle in the reeds; silver beads pass into the sea.

            D                                                      A7
        She comes from a town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter;
              A7                                                    D
        She's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water,
                D                                            Bm
        And she bears it away with a love that the river has taught her.
      Am                           C6              Em/F#
        Let it flow, greatly flow, wide and clear.

        Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed field;
        Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal.
        Broken ground open and beckoning to the spring;
        Black dirt live again.

        The plowman is broad as the back of the land he is sowing,
        As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
        That the work of his day measures more than the planting and growing.
        Let it grow, let it grow, greatly yield.

           C                   G    Bm7
        As well to count the angels dancing on a pin.
     Em/F#          B         G               Em/F#

        And the name is on the earth that takes it in.

        We will not speak but stand inside the rain

        [Jam on verse chords]

        So it goes, we make what we made since the world began;
        Nothin' more, the love of the women, work of men.
        Seasons round, creatures great and small,
        Up and down as we rise and fall.

        Let It Rock  [C.Berry]

        [Intro: C]

        C
        Well up in the evening, down in Mobile, Alabama.

        Working on a railroad with a steel driving hammer.
        F
        Got to make some money, buy some brand new shoes.
        C
        Try to find somebody take away these blues.
        G
        She don't love me here I'm singing in the sun.
        C
        Payday's coming when my work is all done.

        Early in the evening when the sun is sinking low.
        All day I've been waiting for the whistle to blow.
        Sitting in a tee-pee built right on the track.
        Rolling them bones 'till the foreman comes back.
        Pick up your belongings boys and scatter about.
        We got an off scheduled train just two miles out.

        Everybody's scramblin' and a running around.
        Picking up the money, tearing the tee-pee down.
        The foreman was about to panic, 'bout to go insane.
        Trying to get the workers out the way of the train.
        Engineer blowing the whistle loud and long
        Can't stop the train we gotta let it roll on.


        Let Me In 83968  [?]

        A little boy knocked at the warden's door at Sing Sing
        Said in tears, "Yes sir, I understand that 83968 lives here."
        He's my daddy, sir, and I just got to be near him
        And if you can't let him out then you just got to let me in

        Let me in, let me in, 83968's my dad
        I watched the burial of my mama
        Now he's all in the world that I have
        But I can break your little rocks with a hammer in my hand
        I just got to be near daddy, Mr. Warden please let me in

        When I checked through California happy trails out on the rock
        From Folsom on to Jacksonville, no one had my heart
        When I found the newspaper clipping in my mama's souvenirs
        And now I'm here in Sing Sing 83968


        Let Me Sing Your Blues Away  [K.Godchaux/Hunter] (GD2)

        Gonna hop in the hack then turn on the key,
        Pop in the clutch, let the wheels roll free,
        Not a cloud in the sky, such a sunny day,
        Push in the button, let the top ten play.

        Come on honey, let me sing 'em away,
        Come on honey, let me sing 'em away,
        Oh, honey, let me sing your blues away.

        Give me a little of that old time love,
        Cause I ain't never had near enough.
        Honey, walk that walk with style and grace,
        This ain't no knock-down drag-out race.

        It don't matter much, pick any gear,
        Brind you a pound and drop the rear.
        Baby, baby what can I say,
        I'm here to drive those blues away.

        I sent a letter to a man I know,
        Said, "One for the money and two for the show."
        I wait all summer for his reply
        Said, "Three to get ready and four to fly."

        Only two things in the world I love,
        That's rock 'n' roll and my turtle dove.
        When I was a young man I needed good luck,
        But I'm a little bit older now and I know my stuff.

        Come on honey, let me sing 'em away,
        Come on honey, let me sing 'em away,
        Oh, honey, let me sing your blues away.

        Liberty   [Robert Hunter]
   
        Saw a bird with a tear in his eye
        Walking to New Orleans---my, my, my
        Hey, now, Bird, wouldn't you rather die
        than walk this world when you're born to fly?
   
        If I was the sun, I'd look for shade
        If I was a bed, I would stay unmade
        If I was a river I'd run uphill
        And if you call me you know I will

        Mmmm, freedom
        Ooo, liberty
        O ... leave me alone
        to find my own way home
   
        I say what I mean and I don't give a damn
        I do believe and I am who I am
        Hey, now, Mama, come take my hand
        Whole lotta shakin' all over this land
   
        If I was an eagle I'd dress like a duck
        Crawl like a lizard and honk like a truck
        If I get a notion I'll climb this tree
        or chop it down and you can't stop me
   
        Mmmm, freedom
        Ooo, liberty
        O ... leave me alone
        to find my own way home
  
        Went to the well but the water was dry
        Dipped my bucket in the clear blue sky
        Looked in the bottom and what did I see?
        The whole damned world looking back at me
   
        If I was a bottle I'd spill for love
        Sake of mercy I'd kill for love
        If I were a juicer I'd binge for love
        If I were a coward I'd cringe for love
  
        Freedom
        Liberty
        Leave me alone
        to find my own way home
   
 
        Like a Road    [?]
 
        When the road gets too long
        And you run all out of sun
        And the pain gets too much to bear
 
        Turn around, turn around
        Turn around, and I'll be there
        Like a Road, Like a Road leading home
 
        When you wake up and start to cry
        And you need some place to go
        And you want some company that really cares
 
        Turn around...
 
        When the grey clouds pass you by
        And the road you travel on
        Doesn't seem to be goin' anywhere
 
        Turn around...
 


        Lindy  [?]

        I know they're gonna run take me
        When they get across the sea
        Ever' chance, those women; Watch-it's amazing
        It's all safe and now sugar baby

        Oh Mama, don't you weep and moan,
        Uncle Sam got your man and gone.
        Now then they're doin' the Lindy Bird across the sea.

        Oh Mama, how can it be, You went way across the sea
        Just to keep from doing that Lindy fight with me
        Oh baby, well I done just told'ja now

        Oh Mama, don't you weep and moan,
        Uncle Sam got your man and gone.
        Now then they're doin' the Lindy Bird across the sea.

        I asked her for a piece of banana;
        She said, "Let me play the blues on your piano
        And then I'll do that Lindy thing with you."
        Mary had a dream about a submarine.

        I asked her for a glass of payolla;
        She said, "Let me play the blues on your Victrola,
        And then I'll do that Lindy fight with you."


        Little Red Rooster  [W.Dixon]

        I'm a little red rooster, too lazy to crow for days
        Just a little red rooster, too lazy to crow for days
        Keep everything in the barnyard people, upset in every way

        Dogs begin to bark now and the hounds begin to howl
        Dogs begin to bark now and the hounds begin to howl
        Watch out stray cat people
        The little red rooster is on the prowl

        If you see the little red rooster,
        Won't you please drive him home
        If you see my little red rooster,
        Won't you please drive him home
        Been no peace in the barnyard people,
        Since the little red rooster's been gone

        [Brent rap]
        Yeah and the little red rooster, well you ain't shit to me
        Think you're a stud boy, well I doubt you'll ever be
        While your're away I'm gonna fuck with your hens, boy
        I'm just bein' neighborly


        Little Sadie  [Traditional]

        Went down last night to take a look around
        Met little Sadie and I blew her down,
        Went right home, went to bed
        Forty-four colt smokes under my head
        And I began to think what a deed I'd done
        Grabbed my hat and away I run, made a good run,
        But a little too slow
        They overtook me in Jericho

        I'm standin' on the corner ringin' the bell
        Along came the sheriff from Thomasville
        Says "Young man, your name's Brown,
        Remember the night you blew Sadie down?"
        Oh, yes sir, my name is Lee,
        I murdered little Sadie in the first degree
        First degree and the second degree
        Got any papers won't you read 'em to me.

        They took me downtown all dressed in black
        Put me on the train and sent me back
        Sent me back to the county jail,
        I had nobody to go for my bail
        The judge and the jury they took the stand
        The judge hold the paper in his right hand
        Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
        Forty-one years to wear the ball and stripes.


        Little Star  [Weir]

        Lovers we got to be, lovers we are.
        I just wanna be one of those little stars
        One of those stars, that'll be just fine.
        All you gotta do is hang up there and shine.
        Hang up there and shine


        Logger Song  [Traditional]

        As I strolled out one evening within a small cafe
        Forty year-old waitress to me these words did say
        I see you are a logger and not just a common bum
        Cause no one but a logger stirs his coffee with his thumb
        My lover was a logger, but not like none today
        If you pour whiskey on it, he'd eat a bale of hay


        Long Black Limousine  [?]

        Down through the city their fancy cars are such a sight to see
        At first look your rich friends that took you innocently
        That now they finally called you home to me

        Papers told about you lost your life
        Of the party and the famous crash that night
        Racing on the highway that turns nobody saint
        Now you're driving in that long black limousine

        [E D A F#m7 E]

        Did you ever wake unto to the sound, of street cats making love?
        And guess from their cries you were listening to a fight.
        Well you know, hate's just the last thing they're thinking of.
        They're only tryin' to make it through the night.

        [Jam on bridge chords]

        I only want to hold you, I don't want to tie you down
        Or paint you in the lines I might've drawn.
        It's just that I, have gotten used to havin' you around.
        The landscape would be empty, if you were gone.

        Loser  [Garcia/Hunter]

        [Intro: Am]

        Am         G             C         D
        If I had a gun for every ace I've drawn,
        C             Em               Am
        I could arm a town the size of Abilene
        Am                C G    Em             D
        Don't you push me baby, 'cause I'm all alone.
                C        Em   Am    G       Am
        And you know I'm only in it for the gold

        All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars
        And I could pay you back with one good hand
        You can look around about the wide world over
        And you'll never find another honest man.

        [Chorus]
       G          D           A
        Last fair deal in the country, Sweet Suzy.
       G          D           A
        Last fair deal in the town
        G             D                A
        Put your gold money where your love is baby,
          C        Em     Am   G  D        Am
        Before you let my deal go down, go down

        Don't you push me baby, cause I'm all alone.
        Well I know a little something you won't ever know.
        Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee.
        I'm gonna get up in the morning and go.

        [Jam on verse chords]
        [Chorus]

        Everybody prayin' and drinkin' that wine.
        I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines.
        Come to Daddy on the inside straight.
        Well, I got no chance of losing this time.
        Well, I got no chance of losing this time.
                C      G           Am  G     D     Am
        Well, I got no chance of losing this time.

        Louie, Louie  [R.Derry]

        Louie, Louie, me gotta go.  Louie, Louie, me gotta go.
        A fine little girl, she wait for me.
        Me catch the ship across the sea.
        I sailed the ship all alone.  I never think I'll make it home.
        Louie, Louie, me gotta go.  Louie, Louie, me gotta go.
        Three nights and days we sailed the sea.
        Me think of girl constantly.
        On the ship, I dream she there.  I smell the rose in her hair.
        Louie, Louie, me gotta go.  Louie, Louie, me gotta go.
        Me see Jamaican moon above.  It won't be long me see me love.
        Me take her in my arms and then.
        I tell her I never leave again.
        Louie, Louie, me gotta go.  Louie, Louie, me gotta go.


        Love in the Afternoon  [Kahn/Hunter]

        Love, love in the afternoon
        Outside the window an organ grinder's tune

        Rhythm, wine; touch of Jamaica,
        Twilight time with a Kingston lady
        All the time in the world for me and that girl

        Sweet, she sang sweetly; come back soon
        Come back for more of that love in the afternoon

        Breezes blow by me in the afternoon
        She sings sweetly an organ grinder's tune

        Finally recovered from last year's round of bye bye baby blues
        All I crave today some love in the afternoon

        Love, love in the afternoon
        It's easy as she goes, like an organ grinder's tune

        Gone with the moon any old trouble it can't leave too soon
        Trouble's no part of what I want 'specially in the afternoon

        Singin', sleepin' till two
        Wakin' to make more love in the afternoon

        Lucky Old Sun  [?]

        Up in the morning, out on the job, work like a devil, for my pay.
        But that lucky old sun, got nothin' to do,
        But roll around Heaven all day.

        Fuss with my woman, toy with my kid, sweat to I'm wrinkled & grey.
        But that lucky old sun, got nothin' to do,
        But roll around Heaven all day.

        But Lord above can hear me cryin', tears in my eyes.
        But down the dock, with a silver line, lift me to paradise.
        Surely I will tame your calls, wash all my trouble away.
        But that lucky old sun, got nothin' to do,
        But roll around Heaven all day.

        I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
        No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
        Well, I wake in the morning,
        Fold my hands and pray for rain.
        I got a head full of ideas
        That are drivin' me insane.
        It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
        I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.

        I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
        No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
        Well, he hands you a nickel,
        He hands you a dime,
        He asks you with a grin
        If you're havin' a good time,
        Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
        I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.

        I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
        No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
        Well, he puts his cigar
        Out in your face just for kicks.
        His bedroom window
        It is made out of bricks.
        The National Guard stands around his door.
        An, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.

        I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
        No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
        Well, she talks to all the servants
        About man and God and law.
        Everybody says 
        She's the brains behind pa.
        She's sixty-eight but she says she's twenty-four.
        I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.

        I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
        No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
        Well, I try my best
        To be just like I am,
        But everybody wants you
        To be just like them.
        They sing while you slave and I just get bored.
        I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.


        The Maker   [Daniel Lanois]

        Oh Oh Deep Water
        Black and Cold Like the night
        I stand with Arms Wide Open
        I've run a twisted mind (?)
        I'm a stranger in the Eyes of the Maker

        I could not see, For the Fog in my Eyes
        I could not feel, For the Fear in my Life
        From acroos the greate divide
        In the distance I saw a light
        John Baptist walkin to me  with the maker

        My body is bent and broken
        By Love and dangerously (?)
        I can't work the fields of Abraham
        And turn my head away
        I'm not a stranger in the Hands of the Maker

        Brother John, Have you seen the Homeless daughter
        Standing there, with broken wings
        I have seen flaming souls, There over East of Eden
        Burning in the eyes of the Maker
        Burning in the Eyes of the Maker
        Burning in the Eyes of the Maker

        Oh River Rise from your sleep

        The first I remember knowin' was that lonesome whistle blowin'
              D                                A
        And a youngin's dream of growin' up to ride.
             D                     G         D                   G

           D                  A               D
        No one could steer me right, but mama tried.

        Was the only rebel child from a family meek and mild
        Mama seemed to know what lay in store
        In spite of all my Sunday learnin'
        For the bad I kept on turnin'
        And mama couldn't hold me anymore.

                     D                   C                  D

                                     A                D
        That leaves no one but me to blame cause mama tried.

        Dear old daddy rest his soul, left my mom a heavy load
        She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
        Workin' hours without rest, wanted me to have the best
        Oh she tried to raise me right, but I refused.

        And I turned 21 in prison, doin' life without parole
        No one could steer me right, but mama tried, mama tried
        Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleadin' I denied
        That leaves no one but me to blame cause mama tried.

        Man Smart, Women Smarter   [Jack Segal and Harry Belafonte]
        
        Let us put men and women together, 
        see which one is smarter,
        Some say men, but I say no, 
        women got the men like a puppet show.
        
        It ain't me it's the people that say, 
        men are leading women astray,
        I say, it's the women today, 
        smarter than the men in every way,
        That's right the women are smarter, 
        the women are smarted that's right.
         
        Little boy sitting in the corner and cry, 
        big man come and ask him why,
        He said "I can't do what the big boys do", 
        the man sat down and he cried too.
         
        It ain't me it's the people that say, 
        men are leading women astray,
        I say, it's the women today, 
        smarter than the men in every way. 
        That's right the women are smarter, 
        the women are smarted that's right 
         
        Ever since the world began 
        women been imitating the ways of men,
        But listen cause I've got a plan, 
        give it up just don't try to understand. 
        
        It ain't me it's the people that say, 
        men are leading women astray,
        I say, it's the women today, 
        smarter than the men in every way. 
        That's right the women are smarter, 
        the women are smarter that's right.


        Mason's Children  [Garcia/Hunter]

        Mason died on Monday, we bricked him in the wall
        All his children grew and grew,
        They ain't never grown so tall before
        They may never grow so tall again

        We dug him up on Tuesday, he hardly aged a day
        Taught us all we ever knew,
        We ain't never known so much before
        We may never know so much again

        The wall collapsed on Wednesday, we chalked it up to fate
        Mason's children ran and flew,
        They ain't never run so fast before
        Swore they'd never show their face again

        Mason was a mighty man, a mighty man was he
        Always said when I'm dead I'm gone, don't you weep for me

        Thursday came then Friday, with buyers tall and bright
        Mason's children cooked the stew
        And cleaned up when the feast was through

        Take me to the repo-man to pay back what is owed
        If he's in some other land write it off as stole


        Maybe You Know  [Mydland]

        Have you ever wanted something, wanted it so fuckin' bad.
        That you'd lie, that you'd cheat,
        That you'd fight in the street.
        A chance to lose what little you had.

        Maybe you know I'll be there, maybe you know I'll be there
        Maybe you know I'll be there, compared to you,
        I don't seem so mean.

        I've been hearin' for a long time.
        I've been hearin' about some loser band.
        Ain't gettin' younger, but I ain't goin' under.
        I was promised to rock & roll, this is sad.

        Time is only wasted, talkin' that will take your life
        When it all comes down, we're a couple of bums.
        I know I'll get more tonite.

        Now you don't owe me nothin', don't take it so personally.
        There's only one way to make it today
        And I'm doing all I can for me.


        Me and Bobby McGee  [K.Kristofferson]

       D
        Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waitin' for a train,
                                   A
        Feeling nearly faded as my jeans,

        Bobby flagged a diesel down, just before it rained,
                                     D
        Took us all the way to New Orleans.

          D
        I took my harp on out of my dirty red bandanna,
                                               G
        I was blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues,

        With them windshield wipers slappin' time,
       D                      A                              D    D7
        Bobby clappin' hands, we sang every song that driver knew.

        [Chorus]
       G                               D
        Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to do.
       A                                       D  D7
        Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free.
       G                                D
        Feelin' good was easy Lord, when Bobby sang the blues.
       A
        Feelin' good was good enough for me,
                                       D
        Good enough for me and Bobby McGee.

        [Jam - 1st & 2nd verse]

        From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun,
        Bobby shared the secrets of my soul,
        Standing right beside me, Lord, through everything I done,
        Bobby's body kept me from the cold.

        Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away,
        Lookin' for that home, I hope she finds,
        And I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
        Holding Bobby's body close to mine.

        [Chorus]
        Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose.
        Nothin' was all she left for me.
        Feelin' good was easy Lord, when Bobby sang the blues.
        Feelin' good was good enough for me,
        Good enough for me and Bobby McGee.

        [Jam - 1st verse]

        [Chorus]
        Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to do.
        Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free.
        Feelin' good was easy Lord, when Bobby sang the blues.
        Feelin' good was good enough for me,
        Good enough for me and Bobby McGee.   G A D

        And you know it was the hottest part of the day.

                        G              Em
        I took the horses up to the stall,
                          G                      Em
        Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all.
                               G                     Em
        Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt,
                      G                     A Asus4 A Asus4 A
        It bein' summer, I took off my shirt,
              Em                B                  Em  G B Em
        And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt.

                      G                    Em
        West Texas cowboys, they's all around,
                          G                  Em
        With liquor and money, they loaded down.
                         G                        Em
        So soon after payday, know it seemed a shame;
                        G                           A Asus4 A Asus4 A
        You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game,
        Em                    B               Em  G B Em
        High-low jack and the winner take the hand.

        [Jam]

        My uncle starts winnin'; cowboys got sore.
        One of them called him, and then two more,
        Accused him of cheatin'; Oh no, it couldn't be.
        I know my uncle, he's as honest as me,
        And I'm as honest as a Denver man can be.

        One of them cowboys, he starts to draw,
        And I shot him down, Lord, he never saw.
        Shot me another, oh damn he won't grow old.
        In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold,
        And we high-tailed it down to Mexico.

        I love those cowboys, I love their gold,
        I loved my uncle, God rest his soul,
        Taught me good, Lord, Taught me all I know
        Taught me so well, I grabbed that gold
              Em                B                          Em
        And I left his dead ass there by the side of the road.


        Mercy of a Fool  [?]

        She reclines, closing her eyes the silhouette
        Is bound to Writhe
        Light birds and fireflies settle around her
        Days grow, long strange feeling,
        Waterfalls shine this time of year
        Our lives go down the stream,
        Shooting the rapids bright as gold
        The arms you gave me bright as the eye of the hurricane
        We're all just the sage going.
        Every moment is perfect, no sin is a jewel
        If man is a prophet at the mercy of a fool
        Watching seasons go as sunshine turns blue and blue so close

        The great ghost feeling the music is
        Every beat knows its part, keep its spirit in a circle
        The moment is perfect, the eye's a jewel
        If man is a prophet with the mercy of a fool

        Mexicali Blues  [Weir/Barlow]

        [Intro: D A D]

        A                                  C    B     Em
        Laid back in an old saloon, with a peso in my hand,
        A                                  D
        Watchin' flies and children on the street,
              A
        And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls
            C      B      Em
        Who giggle when I smile,
                  A                                D
        There's a little boy who wants to shine my feet.

                 G                    B
        And it's three days ride from Bakersfield
              Em
        And I don't know why I came.
          A                                D
        I guess I came to keep from payin' dues.
             G                B            Em
        So instead I've got a bottle and a girl who's just fourteen,
              A
        And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues. Yeah.

        [Chorus]
        D
        Is there anything a man don't stand to lose,
        D                       A
        When the devil wants to take it all away?
        A
        Cherish well your thoughts,
        A
        And keep a tight grip on your booze,
              A                         Em           A
        Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today.

        [Intro]

        She said her name was Billy Jean and she was fresh in town.
        I didn't know a stage line ran from Hell.
        She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold,
        All the french perfume you'd care to smell.

        She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear,
        "Go on, my friend, do anything you choose."
        Now I'm payin' for those happy hours
        I spent there in her arms,
        With a lifetime's worth of the Mexicali Blues.

        [Chorus]
        [Intro - repeat & jam]

        And then a man rode into town, some thought he was the law.
        Billy Jean was waitin' when he came.
        She told me he would take her, if I didn't use my gun,
        I'd have no one but myself to blame.

        I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind.
        I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news
        'Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord, he didn't even draw
        And now I spent my lifetime running with the Mexicali Blues.

        Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
        When he lets a woman hold him in her hands?
        He just might find himself out there on horseback in the dark
        Just ridin' and runnin' across those desert sands.


        Midnight Hour  [W.Pickett/S.Cropper]

        I'm gonna wait 'till the midnight hour
        That's when my love comes tumbling down
        I'm gonna wait 'till the midnight hour
        When there's nobody else around
        I'm gonna take you girl and hold you
        Do all things I told you in the midnight hour

        I'm gonna hold you in my arms and see the twinkle in your eyes
        I'm gonna wait 'till the midnight hour
        That's when my love begins to shine
        You're the only girl I know
        Really love you so in the midnight hour

        If you ever feel lonesome when you're down in San Antone
      Bm               E                       D
        Beg, steal, or borrow two nickels or a dime
                          G
        To call me on the phone.

       A                                   E
        And I'll meet you at Alamo Mission, where we can say our prayers.

        The Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mother will heal us  as we kneel there.

        [Chorus]

        In the moonlight, in the midnight,

        In the moonlight, midnight, moonlight
               G         D       G        D
        In the moonlight, in the midnight,

        In the moonlight, midnight, moonlight

        If you ever feel sorrow for the deeds you have done.
        With no hope for tomorrow in the setting of the sun.
        And the ocean is howling, for the things that might have been.
        And that last good morning sunrise
        Will be the brightest you've ever seen.

        [Chorus]

        [Jam on |A . . .|. . . .|C . . .|. . . .|]
        [Intro riff on A]

        If you ever feel sorrow for the deeds you have done.
        With no hope for tomorrow in the setting of the sun.
        And the ocean is howling, for the things that might have been.
        And that last good morning sunrise
        Will be the brightest you've ever seen.

        [Chorus] 2x


        Might As Well  [Garcia/Hunter]

        C                                Bb
        Great North Special, were you on board?
        F                              Eb
        Can't find a ride like that no more.
        D
        Night the chariot swung down low
        G                          G7
        Ninety-nine children had a chance to go.


        One long party from front to end
        Tune to the whistle going 'round the bend,
        No big hurry, what do you say?
        Might as well the elegant way.

        [Chorus]
                 C                                             Bb
        Might as well, might as well, (might as well, might as well)
                 F                                             Eb
        Might as well, might as well, (might as well, might as well)
                 D                              G
        Might as well, might as well, (might as well)
                 F              C      F     F# G
        Might as well, might as well, (might as well)
                 F              C      F     F# G
        Might as well, might as well, (might as well)

        Ragtime solid for twenty-five miles
        Then switch over to the cajun style
        Bar car blowing rhythm and blues,
        Rock 'n' roll wailing in the old caboose.

        Long train running from coast to coast
        Bringing home a party when you need it the most
        Whup on the box car, beat on the bell
        Nothing else shaking so you might just as well.

        [Chorus]

    C G                            Bb F
        Never had such a good time,    in my life before.
   F# G                              Bb
        I'd like to have it one time more,
        F        D9        G        E9
        One good ride from start to end,
                   A          Bb    F     F# G
        I'd like to take that ride again, again.

        [Jam on verse chords]

        Ran out of track and I caught the plane
        Back in the county with the blues again
        Great North Special been on my mind
        I might like to ride it just one more time.

        [Chorus]


        The Mighty Quinn  [Dylan]

        [Intro: C F]

       C                 F  C               F
        Everybody's building ships and boats.
       C                    F           C                      F
        Some are building monuments, and some are jotting down notes.
       C            F          C                  F
        Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,

        When Quinn the Eskimo gets here everybody's gonna jump for joy.

        [Chorus]
        C                 G            C
        Come all without, come all within.
                                        F      C
        You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn.
        C                 G            C
        Come all without, come all within.
                                        F      C
        You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn.

        I like my coffee like the rest, I like my sugar sweet.
        But chocolate cubes and making haste, just ain't my cup of meat.
        Everybody's 'neath the trees, feeding pigeons on a limb.
        When Quinn the Eskimo gets here,
        All the pigeons gonna run to him.

        [Chorus]

        If you do what I want you do, I can't decide in my heart
        Tell me where you put it, and I'll tell you who to call.
        Nobody can get no sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes.
        When Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna wanna doze.

        If you're down in Memphis, you best stop down Minglewood
        If you're down in Memphis, you best stop down Minglewood
        When I take a walk down there, all the women sure look good

        If you can't believe me, it'll make it hard to believe in you
        If you can't believe me, it'll make it hard to believe in you
        Cause we all need each other, well you know it's true

        And my number one occupation is stealing women from their men

        Well, I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good.
        Said, I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good.
        Well, the sheriff couldn't catch me,
        But his little girl sure wish she would.

        [Jam]

        Well now the doctor call me crazy, sometimes I am, sometimes I ain't,
        Said now the doctor call me crazy, sometimes I am, sometimes I ain't,
        Yes, and the preacher man call me sinner,
        But his little girl call me saint.

        Well a couple shots of whiskey women round here start looking good,
        I said a couple shots of whiskey women round here start looking good.
        A couple more shots of whiskey, I'm going down to Minglewood.

        I was born in the desert, raised in a lion's den.
        Said, I was born in the desert, raised in a lion's den.
        Yes and my number one occupation is stealing women from their men.
        And I'll do it, do it again.
        Oh, my number one occupation is stealing women from their men.


        Mission in the Rain  [Garcia/Hunter]

          F#m             C#       Em             G
        I turn and walk away then I  come 'round again
           D                 C#m            C#              F#m
        It looks as though tomorrow I'll do pretty much the same.

        I must turn down your offer but I'd like to ask a break
        You know I'm ready to give everything for anything I take.

        |F#m Bbm Bm C#m D| [key change] |A D|

               Bm              E       A       D                  E
        It was midnight in the Mission and the bells were not for me.

        [Chorus]
        E     D   E Bm       C#m         D      E       A
        Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain,
        G     D     Bm       C#m         D      E       A
        Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain.

        Ten years ago, I walked this street my dreams were riding tall
        Tonight I would be thankful Lord, for any dream at all.

        Some folks would be happy just to have one dream come true
        But everything you gather is just more that you can lose.

        [Chorus]
        [Jam]

        All the things I planned to do I only did half way
        Tomorrow will be Sunday born of rainy Saturday.

        There's some satisfaction in the San Francisco rain
        No matter what comes down the Mission always looks the same.

        [Chorus]
        Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain. [4x]

        Cue ball's made of styrofoam and no one's got the time.

        Mississippi Moon  [P.Rowan]

        You tell me you're lonely, I know how you feel.
        Leaning up at the doors, rocking back on my heels.
        She's a wild bird that wandered, too easy to explain
        I knew she had to lose me, to find her own way.

        I'm coming, I'll be coming soon.
        Through the Louisiana pines, to the Mississippi moon.
        Through the Louisiana pines, to the Mississippi moon.

        A wave on the ocean, a whirlwind on the sea.
        I took a notion, that her ship could not land.
        So light me a candle, in the forest so deep.
        Honey, lay down beside me, angels rock us to sleep.

        I'm coming, I'll be coming soon.
        Through the Louisiana pines, to the Mississippi moon.
        Through the Louisiana pines, to the Mississippi moon.

        Money Money  [Weir/Barlow] (GD2)

        My baby gives me the finance blues,
        Tax me to the limit of my revenues.
        Here she comes finger-poppin', clickety-click
        She says furs or diamonds, you take your pick.

        She wants money, what she wants,
        She wants money, what she wants,
        She wants money, what she wants,
        She wants money, what she wants,
        Money money, money money money.
        Money money, money money money.

        She say, "Money, honey", I'd rob a bank,
        I just load my gun and mosey down to the bank.
        Knockin' off my neighborhood savings and load,
        To keep my sweet chiquita in eau de cologne.

        She wants money, what she wants,
        She wants money, what she wants,
        Money money, money money money.
        Money money, money money money.

        Mama don't send me down to rob that bank again,
        I got a notion that your leadin' me to sin.
        Won't you relax, won't you lay way back,
        Don't you bug your honey 'bout no Cadillac.
        It's only bucks, you don't need no jack.
        So won't you please relax and lay way back.

        My baby's lovin' gives me such a thrill;
        It gives me inspiration makin' counterfeit bills.
        Now some folks say the best things in life are free,
        I sure don't get no lovin' livin' honestly.

        She wants money, what she wants,
        She wants money, what she wants,
        Money money, money money money.
        Money money, money money money.

        Lord made a lady out of Adam's rib,
        Next thing you know, you got women's lib.
        Lovely to look upon, Heaven to touch;
        It's a real shame that they got to cost so much.


        Monkey and the Engineer  [J.Fuller]

        [Intro: G A D G]

        G                             C   G
        Once upon a time there was an engineer.
            G                       A       D
        Who drove a locomotive both far and near.
          G                               C
        Accompanied by a monkey who would sit on a stool,
        G             A             D          G
        Watching everything the engineer would do.

        One day the engineer wanted a bite to eat,
        He left the monkey sitting on the driver's seat.
        The monkey pulled the throttle, locomotive jumped the gun
        And did 90 miles an hour down the mainline run.

        [Chorus]
        G              C        G
        Big locomotive right on time,
        G                     A        D
        Big locomotive coming down the line.
        G                      C
        Big locomotive, number ninety-nine,
        G            A           D       G
        Left the engineer with a worried mind.

        [Jam on verse chords]

        The engineer called up the dispatcher on the phone,
        To tell him all about his locomotive was gone.
        To get on the wire, switch operator to right,
        Cause the monkey's got the mainline sewed up tight.

        Switch operator got the message in time,
        Said there's a Northbound limit on the same main line,
        Open up the switch I'm gonna let him through the hole,
        Cause the monkey's got the locomotive under control.

        [Chorus]
        [Jam on verse chords]
        [Chorus]
        Left the engineer with a worried mind.
        Left the engineer with a worried mind.


        Morning Dew  [B.Dobson]

      G                             D       A     E
        I can't walk you out in the morning dew today.


        I thought I heard a baby cry this morning,
        I thought I heard a baby cry this today.
        You didn't hear no baby cry this morning,
        You didn't hear no baby cry today.

        Where have all the people gone my honey,
        Where have all the people gone today.
        There's no need for you to be worrying about all those people,
        You never see those people anyway.

        I thought I heard a young man mourn this morning,
        I thought I heard a young man mourn today.
        I thought I heard a young man mourn this morning,
        I can't walk you out in the morning dew today.

        Walk me out in the morning dew my honey,
        Walk me out in the morning dew today.
        I'll walk you out in the morning dew my honey,
        I guess it doesn't matter anyway,
        I guess it doesn't matter anyway (repeat ad lib)

        More than laurel you may sow.
        Hey, the laurel, hey the city in the rain,
        Hey, hey, hey the wild wheat waving in the wind.

        Twenty degrees of solitude, twenty degrees in all,
        All the dancing kings and wives assembled in the hall.
        Lost is the long and loneliest town fairly sybil flying.
        All along the, all along the mountains of the moon.

        Hey, Tom Banjo it's time to matter,
        The earth will see you on through this time,
        The earth will see you on through this time.

        Down by the water, the Marsh King's daughter, did you know?
        Clothed in totters always will be.  Tom, where did you go?

        Mountains of the moon, Electra, mountains of the moon,
        All along the, all along the mountains of the moon.

        They're a band beyond description, like Jehovah's favorite choir.
        People joining hand 'n' hand, while the music plays the band.
        Lord, they're settin' us on fire.

        Crazy rooster crowin' midnight, balls of lightin' roll along.
        Old men sing about their dreams, women laugh and children scream
        And the band keeps playin' on.

        [Bridge]
        Keep on dancin' thru the daylight, greet the mornin' air with song.
        No one's noticed but the band's all packed and gone.
        Was it ever here at all? But they kept on dancin'.
        C'mon children, c'mon children, come on clap your hands.

        Well the cool breeze came on Tuesday, and the corn's a bumper crop.
        And the fields are full of dancin', full of singin' and romancin'.
        The music never stopped.

        My Babe  [W.Dixon]

        My baby don't stand no foolin' with love.


        My Sisters and My Brothers   [?]

        I want to say to my sisters & my brothers, keep the faith.
        When the storm flies & the wind blows, go on at a steady pace.
        When the battle is fought & the victories won.
        We can all shout together, we have overcome.
        We will talk to the father in the sun,
        When we make it to the promised land.

        [Refrain]
        If we walk together little children.
        We don't ever have to worry, through this world of trouble.
        We've got to love a-one another.
        Let us take our fellow man, by the hand, try to help him to understand.
        We can all be together, forever and ever,
        When we make it to the promised land.

        Our bible reads, thall shall not be afraid
        Of the terror by night or the arrow that flies by day.
        Nor for the pessimists that walketh in the dark,
        Nor for the destruction that waiteth in the noonday hour.
        
        [Refrain]

        This world is not our home, we are only passing through.
        Our trail is all made up, way beyond the blue.
        Let us do the very best that we can,
        While we're travelin' through this land.
        We will all be together, shakin' a hand,
        When we make it to the promised land.
       
        When we make it to the promised land, make it to the promised land.
        When we make it to the promised land, make it to the promised land.
        We can all be together, forever and ever
        When we make it to the promised land.
        When we make it to the promised land.
        When we make it to the promised land.

        Never Trust A Woman (Good Times Blues)  [Brent Mydland]

        I see some good times, I gotta get to ring that bell
        I gotta see some good times
        Sometimes you make up for when I'm not feeling well
        It must be due to some great times
        Cause right now I feel like hell

        Never trust a woman who wears her pants too tight
        Never trust a woman who wears her pants too tight
        She might love you tomorrow, but she'll be gone tomorrow night

        Come tomorrow I'll get my pay to leave this town
        Come tomorrow I'll get my pay to leave this town
        She don't really love me, ain't no reason to stick around


        New Orleans  [F.Guida/J.Royster]

        Well, come on everybody take a trip with me
        Down the Mississippi, down to New Orleans
        They got the honeysuckle blaming on the honeysuckle vine
        And love is blaming there all the time
        They got the French boys swinging from a big old tree
        Down the Mississippi, down in New Orleans

        Well, come on take a stroll down on Basin Street
        And listen to the music and the Dixieland beat
        Oh, Magnolia blossom fills the air
        And you ain't been to heaven if you ain't been there
        Every Southern Belle is a Mississippi Queen
        Down the Mississippi, down in New Orleans


        New Potato Caboose  [R.Peterson] (GDA)

        Last leaf fallen bare earth where green was born,
        Black Madonna two eagles hang against a cloud,
        Sun comes up blood red wind yells among the stone,
        All graceful instruments are known.

        When the windows all are broken
        And your love's become a toothless crone,
        When the voices of the storm sound like a crowd,
        Winter morning breaks, you're all alone.

        The eyes are blind, blue visions, all a seer can own,
        And touching makes the flesh to cry out loud
        This ground on which the seed of love is sown,
        All graceful instruments are known.


        New Speedway Boogie  [Garcia/Hunter] (GD1)

        [Intro: E]

        E
        Please don't dominate the rap, Jack,
        If you've got nothing new to say.
        If you please, don't back up the track this train's got to run today.

                                     E7
        I spent a little time on the mountain,
        E
        Spent a little time on the hill.
        E
        I heard some say, "Better run away,"
         G           D            A
        Others say, "Better stand still."

            E
        Now I don't know, but I been told
                G      D           A
        It's hard to run with the weight of gold.
        E
        Other hand I heard it said,
                G       D         A               |E . . .| 4x
        It's just as hard with a weight of lead.

        E
        Who can deny, who can deny it's not just a change in style?
        One step done and another begun and I wonder how many miles.

                                     E7
        I spent a little time on the mountain,
        E
        Spent a little time on the hill.
                                                        G    D       A
        Things went down we don't understand, but I think in time we will.

            E
        Now I don't know but I was told
               G           D         A
        In the heat of the sun a man died of cold.
        E
        Keep on coming or stand and wait,
                   G       D         A
        With the sun so dark and the hour so late.

        [Jam on E]

        E
        You can't overlook the lack, Jack, of any other highway to ride.
        It's got no signs or dividing lines, and very few rules to guide.

                                     E7
        I spent a little time on the mountain,
        E
        Spent a little time on the hill.
                                                G      D      A
        I saw things getting out of hand, I guess they always will.

            E
        Now I don't know but I been told,
               G           D               A
        If the horse don't pull you got to carry the load.
        E
        I don't know whose back's that strong;
        G          D     A
        Maybe find out before too long.

        E
        One way or another, one way or another,
        One way or another, this darkness got to give.


        Next Time You See Me  [William Harvey and Earl Forest]

        Next time you see me things won't be the same,
        Next time you see me things won't be the same,
        If it hurts you my darling, you only got yourself to blame.

        Well, it's true, true saying, all that shines is not gold.
        Well, it's true, true saying, all that shines is not gold.
        Like the good book says, you gotta reap what you sow.

        Well, you lied, cheated -- woh-oh! for so long,
        Well, you lied, cheated -- woh-oh! for so long,
        You were wrong to do it woman, and another queen is on your throne.

        Next time you see me things won't be the same,
        Next time you see me things won't be the same,
        If it hurts you my darling, you only got yourself to blame.

        Well, it's true, true saying, all that shines is not gold.
        Well, it's true, true saying, all that shines is not gold.
        Like the good book says, you gotta reap what you sow.


        The Night They Drove Ole Dixie Down  [J.R. Robertson]

      Am       C                       F             Em       Dm
        Virgil Caine is the name and I served on the Danville train
      Am                C                F           Em      Dm
        Till Stoneman's cavalry came and tore up the tracks again
      Am                  F          C            F
        In the winter of '65, we was hungry, just barely alive
      Am           F                           C      F               D
        By May 10, Richmond had fell, it was a time I remember, oh so well

        [Chorus]
            C          F               C             F
        The night they drove ole Dixie down, all the bells were ringing
            C          F               C             F
        The night they drove ole Dixie down, all the people were singing
       C             Am        G                  F                 C F C
        Na, na na na na na na, na na na na na na, na na na na na na

        Like my father before me, I'm a peaceful man
        Like my brother before me, I took a rebel stand
        Just 18, proud and gray, but a Yankee laid him in his grave
        Swear by the blood running through my feet
        You can't raise a Caine back up when he's in defeat

        [Chorus]
        [Jam on verse & chorus]

        Back with my wife in Tennessee one day she called for me
        Virgil quick come see there goes the "Robert E. Lee"
        I don't mind chopping wood and I don't care if the money's no good
        Take what you need and leave the rest
        They should never have taken the very best

        [Chorus] 2x


        Nobody's Fault But Mine  [Traditional]

        Nobody's fault but mine if I don't read my soul gets lost
        Nobody's fault but mine
        Had a Bible in my hand, had a Bible in my arm

        My mother she taught me how to read
        My mother she taught me how to read
        If I don't read my soul gets lost
        Nobody's fault but mine, nobody's fault but mine


        Not Fade Away  [B.Holly]

        I wanna tell you how it's gonna be,
        You're gonna give your love to me,
        I wanna love you night and day,
        You know my love not fade away.
        You know my love not fade away, not fade away!

        My love is bigger than a Cadillac,
        I try to show you but you drive me back,
        Your love for me has got to be real,
        You're gonna know just how I feel.

        Our love is real, not fade away, not fade away!


        No Tomorrow  [?]

        Look over yonder tell me what you see
        Ten thousand people looking after me
        I may be famous, I may be no-one,
        But in the end all our races are run
        Don't make my race run in vain, seems like there's no tomorrow
        Seems like all my yesterdays were fitted in pain
        There's nothing but darkness tomorrow

        If you got to do like you said you do
        If you got to change your mind and walk away
        It don't seem to matter much anymore
        Don't even ask me the time of day 'cause I don't know

        Don't make me live in this pain no longer
        You know I'm getting weaker not stronger
        My poor heart can't stand much more
        So why don't you just stop talking if you got to walk that dog
        You start walking

        I'll get by somehow, maybe not tomorrow, but somehow
        I know someday I'll find someone who can ease my pain
        Like you once done, yes, I know we had a good thing goin'
        Seemed like a long time, like a long time

        I didn't realize what was happenin' to my life
        Till it was almost too late to say this
        When I needed you, I needed you to lean on
        You took your love and never gave it
        Well this time is goodbye, so long
        Maybe I must say "Take care and goodbye, so long"
        Goodbye little girl I'm gone

        You can go out and take your love
        And give it to anybody who but a fool like me, would take it?
        And maybe if they got a strong, strong heart
        Then your love won't break it, but I'm gone, goodbye so long



        Oh Babe, it Ain't No Lie   [Elizabeth Cotten]

        One old woman, Lord, in this town,
        Keeps a-tellin' her lies on me.
        Wish to my soul that old woman would die;
        Keeps a-tellin' her lies on me.

        Oh, baby, it ain't no lie,
        Oh, baby, it ain't no lie,
        Oh, baby, it ain't no lie,
        You know this life I'm livin's mighty high.

        Been all around this whole round world;
        Lord, I just got back today.
        Work all the week, honey, and give it all to you;
        Honey babe, what more can I do?

        Oh, baby, it ain't no lie,
        Oh, baby, it ain't no lie,
        Oh, baby, it ain't no lie,
        You know this life I'm livin's mighty high.



        Oh Boy  [B.Holly]

        All my love, all my kissin' you don't know what you been missing
        Oh boy, when you're with me
        Oh boy, all the world would see that you were meant for me

        All my life I've been waitin', tonight there will be no hesitatin'
        Oh boy, when you're with me
        Oh boy, all the world would see that you were meant for me

        Stars up here and the shadow is fallin'
        You can hear my heart's been callin'
        Little bit lonely every things right
        I'm gonna see my baby tonight


        Oakie From Muskogee  [M.Haggard]

        We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee;
        We don't take our trips on LSD;
        We don't burn our draft cards down on Main Street;
        We like livin' right, and bein' free.

        We don't make a party out of lovin';
        We like holdin' hands and pitchin' woo;
        We don't let our hair grow long and shaggy,
        Like the hippies out in San Francisco do.

        I'm proud to be an Oakie from Muskogee,
        A place where even squares can have a ball.
        We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse,
        And white lightin's still the biggest thril of all.

        Leather boots are still in style for mainly footwear;
        Beads and roman sandals won't be seen.
        Football's still the roughest thing on campus,
        And the kids here still respect the college dean.

        And I'm proud to be an Oakie from Muskogee,
        A place where even squares can have a ball.
        We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse,
        And white lightin's still the biggest thril of all.

        We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse,
        In Muskogee, Oklahoma, USA.


        Ol Slew-Foot    [?]

            (variation on Bear Tracks)

        [Begins]
        High on the mountain, what do you see?
        Bear tracks, bear tracks, looking back at me
        You'd better get your rifles boys before it's too late
        The bear's got a little pig and headed through the gate

        [chorus]
        Oh he's big around the middle and he's broad across the rump
        Running ninety miles an hour, taking thirty feet a jump
        He's never been caught, he ain't never been treed
        Some folks say he looks a lot like me

        I saved up my money and I bought me some bees
        They started making honey way up in the trees
        I chopped down the tree but my honey's all gone
        Ol' Slew Foot's done and made himself at home

        [chorus]

        Winter's coming and it's twenty below
        The river's froze over so where can he go
        We chase him up the gully and run him in the well
        And shoot him in the bottom just to listen to him yell

        [chorus]

             Am               C                                  G
        They used to heed the words you said, but that was yesterday.
        C                 D         G               C
        Gold will turn to grey, and youth will fade away.
                Am          C                                 G
        They'll never care about you, call you old and in the way.

       D                        G
        Once I hear tell he was happy,
           C                G              D
        He had his share of friends & good times.
                  C
        Now those friends have all passed on,
                 G                   Em
        He don't have a place called home.
                Am               C                           G
        Looking back to a better day, feeling old and in the way.

        [Chorus]
        [Jam on chorus chords]

        When just a boy he left his home,
        Thought he'd have the world on a string.
        Now the years have come and gone,
        Through the streets he walks alone.
        "I'm the old dog on the stray", he's just old and in the way.

        [Chorus]

       They'll never care about you, call you old and in the way.

        If you ever hear a church bell toll.
        If you ever hear, a church bell toll.
        You'll know by that I'm dead and gone.

        [Jam]

        Dig my grave with a silver spade. Dig my grave with a silver spade.
        Dig my grave, with a silver spade. Mark the place where I would lay.

        Just one kind favor I ask of you, one kind favor I ask of you.

        One More Saturday Night  [Weir] (GDA)

          C7
        I went down to the mountain, I was drinking some wine,
        I looked up into heaven; Lord I saw a mighty sign,
        Writ in fire across the heaven, plain as black and white:
        "Get prepared. There's gonna be a party tonight."

        [Chorus]
              F7                   C7            G7 F7
        Uh-huh, hey Saturday night.   Yeah, uh-huh, One more Saturday night.
                         C7
        Hey, Saturday night.

        Everybody's dancin' down at the local armory,
        With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery.
        Temperature keeps risin'; everybody gittin' high.
        Come the rockin' stroke of midnight, the whole place gonna fly.

        [Chorus]
        [Jam on verse and chorus chords]

        I turn on Channel Six. The President comes on the news.
        Says, "I get no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues."
        His wife says, "Don't get crazy, Lord, you know just what to do,
        Crank up that old Victrola. Put on your rockin' shoes."

        [Chorus]

        Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth,
        Thought He'd have a big old party; thought He'd call it planet earth.
        Don't worry about tomorrow. Lord, you'll know it when it comes,
        When the rockin', rollin' music meets the risin', shinin' sun.

        One Thing To Try  [Robert Hunter]

        Break out your bottle, be in trouble by noon
        Never get satisfaction cause ya boil too soon
        Them downtown chippies know your weight to the ounce
        But the harder you fall, Jack, the higher you bounce!

        Stoke up your get, be ready to ride
        Keep your head and your heart inside
        Take it as far as you wanna go
        Until we can't see the desert for the burning snow

        But if you're in a hurry, I really go to go,
        If you're in a hurry, might have to find out slow
        That it's one thing to try, another to fly,
        You get there quicker just a step at a time,
        It's one thing to bark and another to bite,
        The show ain't over til you pack up at night.

        Ah well, ninety-nine people all running around
        Not one in a hundred got his feet on the ground,
        In fact one in a thousand holding some in reserve
        For when the real, true action comes around the curve.

        Take care of your people, get some of them fed
        Hide the ones in trouble out under your bed
        Keep an eye to the future, an ear to the past
        Cause after thinkin' it over, know there's nothing much lasts.

        So if you're in a hurry, I really go to go
        If you're in a hurry, might have to find out slow
        That it's one thing to try, another to fly,
        You get there quicker just a step at a time,
        It's one thing to bark and another to bite,
        The show ain't over til you pack up at night.

        Don't ever let it get the best of you
        Plan what you can, let the rest shine through
        Just so many angles you can possibly see
        Got to figure on those let the other ones be

        Don't be a collector of more than you need
        Got a lot of things growing but keep watching your seeds
        Got to sprout in December what you planted in May
        If the harvest is empty, find some other good way

        But if you're in a hurry, I really go to go,
        If you're in a hurry, might have to find out slow
        That it's one thing to try, another to fly,
        You get there quicker just a step at a time,
        It's one thing to bark and another to bite,
        The show ain't over til you pack up at night.


        On The Road Again  [Traditional]

        C
        Why I married a bad girl, tell you the reason why
        Bad girls will even do things on the sly
        Look for your dinner to be good and hot
        She never even put a stew bone in the pot

                     F
        She's on the road again, sure as you're born
        C
        Natural born easy on the road again
                     F
        She's on the road again, sure as you're born

        Friend come by, say looking for his hat
        Wants to know where your husband's at
        I don't know, he's on his way to the pen
        Come on pretty mama, let's get on the road again

        [Chorus]
        [Jam]

        Went to my house my front door was locked
        Went 'round to my window, but my window was locked
        Jumped right back, shook my head,
        Big old rounder in my folding bed
        Jumped into the window, broke the glass
        Never seen that little rounder run so fast

        [Chorus x2]


        Operator  [McKernan] (GDA,GD1)

        [Intro: |F . . .|C . . A |Dm . . C |F . . .|. . . .| ]

       F
        Operator, can you help me? Help me if you please.
        Bb                                     F
        Give me the right area code and the number that I need.
      F#   G                   C
        My rider left upon the Midnight Flyer
     A7 Dm                 C  F
        Singin' like a summer breeze.

        I think she's somewhere down south, down about Baton Rouge.
        But I just can't remember no number, a number I can use.
        Directory don't have it, Central done forgot it;
        Got to find a number to use.

        |F . . .|C . . A |Dm . . C |F . . .|. . . .|

        Trying to check out her number, trying to run down her line.
        Op'rator said that's priv'ledged information
        And it ain't no business of mine.
        It's flooding down in Texas, the poles are out in Utah;
        Gotta find a private line.

        She could be hanging 'round a steel mill,
        Working in a house of blue lights,
        Riding a getaway bus out of Portland, talking to the night.
        I don't know where she's going, I don't care where she's been,
        Long as she's been doin' it right.

        [Jam on verse chords]

        Other One  [Weir/Kreutzmann] (GDA)

        Spanish lady comes to me, she lays on me this rose.
        It rainbow spirals round and round it trembles and explodes.
        It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away.
        But the heat came 'round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day.

        Comin', comin', comin' around, comin', around,
        comin', around, in a circle
        Comin', comin', comin' around, comin' around, in a circle,
        Comin', comin', comin' around, comin' in a circle.

        Skippin' through the lily fields I came across an empty space,
        It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in it's place.
        The bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began,
        There was cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to never ever land.

        Comin', comin', comin' around, comin', around,
        comin', around,  in a circle
        Comin', comin', comin' around, comin' around, in a circle,
        Comin', comin', comin' around, comin' in a circle.


        Pain In My Heart   [?] 

        Pain in my heart, treating me cold
        Where can my baby be, Lord no-one knows
        Pain in my heart, won't let me sleep
        I wake up at night in misery, yes I do
        And when my days begin to get rough
        Why don't you come back, come back, came back baby
        I've had enough

        Of this little old
        Pain in my heart, won't let me be
        Oh I wake up at night in misery
        Pain in my heart, treating me cold
        Where can my baby be, Lord no-one knows, no they don't
        And when my days begin to get rough
        Won't you love me, love me, love me baby
        Cause I've had enough




        Palm Sunday  [Garcia/Hunter]

        The river so white the mountain so red
        And with the sunshine over my head
        The honky-tonks are closed and hushed
        It must be Palm Sunday again

        I'll bet your woman's up in bed with, Panama Red.

                        D
        The judge don't know when Red's in town,
                      G
        He keeps will hidden underground.
                 A                           D
        But everybody's acting lazy, falling out and hangin' 'round.
                                                     G

        And if you don't feel like working, Panama Red is back in town.

        [Chorus]
        [Jam on verse and chorus chords]

        Everybody's looking out for him, 'cause they know Red's satisfied.
        Little girls love to listen, to him sing and tell sweet lies.
        My mama thinks me too confusing, "Honey, you're better off in bed."
        My mama's searching all the joints in town for Panama Red.

        [Chorus]


        Passenger  [Lesh/P.Monk] (GDA)

        Firefly, can you see me?
        Shine on, glowing, brief and brightly
        Could you imagine?  One summer day,
        That same night be on your way

        Do you remember?  Hearts were too cold
        Seasons have frozen us into our souls
        People were sayin' the whole world is burning
        Ashes have scattered too hard to turn

        Upside out or inside down
        False alarm, the only game in town
        No man's land, the only game in town
        Terrible, the only game in town

        Passenger, don't you hear me?
        Destination seen unclearly.
        What is a man deep down inside,
        What a raging beast with nothing to hide.

        Upside out or inside down
        False alarm, the only game in town
        No man's land, the only game in town
        Terrible, the only game in town

        Picasso Moon  [Weir/Barlow]

        South of Market in the land of ruin
        You'll find all manner of action,
        Tinsel tigers in the Metal Room,
        Stalking satisfaction.
        They got 'em packaged up for love and money
        Tattooed tots and chrome spike bunnies
        I found my mirrored shades ready to see
        And roll on in, gonna roll in it, honey

        I get a feeling like when big things collide
?       Crack a fub of thunder like I'm really on high
?       Here comes middle ages, she looks ready to ride
        What's that she's trying to show me?
        What's that she's trying to show me?

        Picasso moon, shattered light
        Diamond bullets ripping up the night
        Picasso moon, liberate me.
        Ah, life's infinite diversity.
        Great amazing majesty.
        And it's bigger than a drive-in movie, oooh wee
        Bigger than a drive-in movie, oooh wee.

        Hangin' ten out on space and time,
        Redefining distance.
        The next skull on your necklace is mine,
        Cheap for such assistance.
        I had a job trading bits for pieces.
        We'd make wrinkles, advertise them as creases.
        Please find my resignation enclosed.
        Roll in it, come on let's roll in it, honey.

        Dark Angel, what's botherin' you?
?       Some stranger do me all that you do.
?       Dark Angel, you making it blue.
        I guess it doesn't matter.
        I guess it doesn't matter.

?       Picasso moon, widening ball.
?       I feel a quake and ding I hear the call
?       Picasso moon, river sky
        Amazing, blazing, mystify.
?       It's, rude a wind, I wanna fly
        And it's bigger than a drive-in movie, oh my.
        Bigger than a drive-in movie, oh my.

        Strikes the morning, the atomic dawn,
        Scramble back to cover.
        Quick, pop your mirrored sunglasses on,
        My little leather-winged lover.
        I see your face printed on my money.
?       Your blazing ways really move me, honey.
?       Harder days, yeah yeah.
        Why'm I laughing? This ain't funny?

        Dark angel, now just don't start.
        You break my spirit, you break my heart.
        You must have a license for practicing that art
?       That don't presume to magic
?       No I, don't presume to magic

        Picasso moon, fractal flame
        Blazing lace filling every frame
        Picasso moon, wheels within wheels
?       The bells are ringin', it's quite unreal
        Trying to tell y'all about just how I feel
        And it's bigger than a drive-in movie, for real.
        Bigger than a drive-in movie, for real.

        Picasso moon, shattered light
        Diamond bullets ripping up the night
        Picasso moon, liberate me.
?       Picasso moon, widening ball
?       I feel the quake and ding I hear the call
        Picasso moon, fill the sky
        Picasso moon, fractal flame
        Blazing lace filling every frame
        Picasso moon, wheels within wheels
        Picasso moon, shining bright
        The universe is working fine tonight
        Picasso moon, illuminate me

        Corn to feed him on;
        All I need is a pretty little girl
        To feed him when I'm gone.

        Dark clouds a-risin',
        Sure sign of rain.
        Get your old grey bonnet on,
        Sweet little Liza Jane.

        CHORUS

        Bake 'em biscuits, baby,
        Bake 'em good and brown.

        To sow a little cane;

        Positively 4th Street  [Dylan]

        You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
        When I was down you just stood there grinning
        You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend
        You just want to be on the side that's winning

        You say I let you down you know it's not like that
        If you're so hurt why then don't you show it
        You say you lost your faith but that's not where it's at
        You had no faith to lose and you know it

        I know the reason that you talk behind my back
        I used to be among the crowd you're in with
        Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
        With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with

        You see me on the street you always act surprised
        You say, "How are you?" "Good luck" but you don't mean it
        When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed
        Why don't you just come out once and scream it

        No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace
        If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them
        And now I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place
        Don't you understand it's not my problem

        I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
        And just for that one moment I could be you
        Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
        You'd know what a drag it is to see you


        Pride of Cucamonga  [Lesh/Peterson] (GD2)

        Out on the edge of an empty highway,
        Howling at the blood on the moon,
        Big diesel Mack truck rolling down my way,
        Can't hit that border too soon.
        Running hard out of Muskrat Flats, it was sixty days or double life,
        Hail on my back like a shotgun blast, high wind chimes in the night.

        Oh, oh the Pride of Cucamonga, oh, oh bitter olives in the sun,
        Oh, oh I had me some lovin', and I done some time.

        Since I came down from Oregon, there's a lesson or two I've learned
        By standing in the road alone, standing watching the fires burn.
        The northern sky it stinks with greed,
        You can smell it for miles around,
        Good ole boys in the Greystone Hotel, sitting doing that git on down.

        Oh, oh the Pride of Cucamonga, of, of silver apples in the sun,
        Oh, oh I had me some lovin', and I done some time.

        I see your silver shining town, but I know I can't go there --
        Your streets run deep with poisoned wine,
        Your doorways crawl with fear.
        So I think I'll drift for ol' where it's at,
        Where the weed grows green and fine
        And wrap myself around a bush of that bright, whoa, on Oaxaca vine.

        Yes, it's me, I'm the Pride of Cucamonga,
        I can see golden forests in the sun.


        Promised Land  [C.Berry]

        [Intro: a a a a |A . . .|D . . .|]
        [Key change to C]

        C                                                  F
        Left my home in Norfolk Virginia, California on my mind.
        G
        Straddled that Greyhound, it rode me past Raleigh,
                          C
        And on across Caroline.

        Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill,
        And we never was a minute late.
        We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown,
        Rollin' 'cross the Georgia state.

        Had motor trouble it turned into a struggle, half way 'cross Alabam,
        The 'hound broke down & left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham.

        [Jam]

        Straight off bought me a through train ticket,
        Right across Mississippi clean
        And I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
        Smoking into New Orleans.

        Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
        Just help me get to Houston town.
        People are there who care a little 'bout me
        And they won't let the poor boy down.

        Sure as she bore me, she bought me a silk suit,
        Put luggage in my hands,
        And I woke up high over Albequerque
        On a jet to the promised land.

        [Jam]

        Workin' on a T-bone steak a la carte,
        Flying over to the Golden State;
        When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes
        We'd be headin' in the terminal gate.

        Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
        Taxi to the terminal zone;
        Cut your engines, cool your wings,
        And let me make it to the telephone.

        Los Angeles give me Norfolk Virginia,
        Tidewater four-ten-o-nine
        Tell the folks back home this is the promised land callin'
        And the poor boy's on the line.

        [Jam]


        Promontory Rider  [R.Hunter]

        Promontory Rider, Territory Ranger.
        Promontory Rider, whats makes you ride so high?
        Put a loving star back in an empty sky.
        Once the wind was warm and sweet, the ladies in lace.
        Up there on the prominence the tears just freeze your face.
        From a statutory picture, passport out of hell.
        Left here by a stranger, seem to wish as well.
        Sighed, Promontory Rider, Territory Ranger.

        Asked me, "Can you thread a needle?  Can you shoot the moon?"
        Walk the silver screen, be a judgement at high noon?
        Like any Promontory Rider, Territory Ranger, step up.

        Ride on, ride on, ride
        Ride upon the high ground, ride upon the low.
        Promontory Rider what makes you ride so slow?
        Pick me out with harden wings and fill my head with crowds.
        I been crawlin' in this scene, but now I'm rollin' down.

        Promontory Rider, Territory Ranger.
        Promontory Rider used to ride so high.
        I don't know these days just seem to ride on by.
        Once the wind was warm and sweet, but this must be your place.
        Cause you don't change this chilly range, for any other place.
        Say, Promontory Rider, Territory Ranger.

        Ride on, ride on, ride.
        Promontory Rider, whats makes you ride so high?
        Put a loving star back in an empty sky.
        Movin' on the high ground, movin' on the low.
        But Promontory Rider that was many years ago.
        Pick me out with harden wings and fill my head with crowds.
        I been crawlin' in this scene, but not I'm rollin' down.
        Promontory Rider, Territory Ranger.

        Movin' on the high ground, movin' on the low ground.
        Promontory Rider step so high
        I know I oculd be right and I maybe wrong.
        But I'll think I'll miss you when your gone.
        ABC WXYZ can ask for cover, just don't see me

        When your mother sends back   all your  invitations
                 G              F#m   Em           A
        And your father to your sister  he explains

        That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations
        D              A            D    G
        Won't you come see me Queen Jane?
        D              A            D
        Won't you come see me Queen Jane?

        Now when all of the flower ladies want back what they have lent you
        And the smell of their roses does not remain
        And all of your children start to resent you
        Won't you come see me Queen Jane?
        Won't you come see me Queen Jane?

        [Jam]

        Now when all the clowns that you have commissioned
        Have all died in battle or in vain
        And you're sick of all this repetition
        Won't you come see me Queen Jane?
        Won't you come see me Queen Jane?

        When all of your advisers heave their plastic
        At your feet to convince you of your pain
        Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic
        Won't you come see me Queen Jane?
        Won't you come see me Queen Jane?

        [Jam]

        Now when all the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
        All lay down their bandanas and complain
        And you want somebody you don't have to speak to
        Won't you come see me Queen Jane?
        Won't you come see me Queen Jane?
        Won't you come and see me Queen Jane?
        Won't you come and see me Queen Jane?
        Won't you come and see me Queen Jane?  G F#m Em D


        Queen Of Santa Fe I  [?]

        When I was a boy about seventeen I went down to the railroad yard
        I hopped on Santa Fe Queen all the way to Boston for coal mines
        I lit out from my home I hitch hiked to Statson
        I went around there, found me a yard, I asked the old hobo, said:
        Said, "I don't care, man, I just ride the ride."


        Queen Of Santa Fe II (Poor Michael Went Down)  [?]

        Well you know I left my home when I was seventeen years of age
        Started hitch hiking from San Francisco down to L.A.
        And I, I met this man giving me a ride
        Amd finally got me by my side said, "Hey son have a dime."
        I say, "Thank you" and he was on his way
        So I got down in the big cities and I was trying to get myself a job

        But there wasn't no jobs around
        I couldn't seem to find anyway to make guineas
        And this man at the gas station, he says,
        "Son you need yourself a job?" and I said "Mr. I surely do."
        He said "Welcome in, I give you a dollar and a 1/4 an hour"
        That's sure good handling that time

        So I worked in the gas station for a while
        And I got myself a Plymouth mobile, yes I did
        That was comin' on pretty good up to one day
        I kind of let down on my lovin' down for a 1/4 an hour
        Couldn't go far out working overtime I need a lot of money
        That lot of money I don't know what to do

        So I met one of these guys who'd walk around in the neighborhood
        Behind this other gas station we figure we'd check it out pretty good
        So we decided we're gonna rob this gas station
        Because there was no other way ot get no money
        And then one night when there was no one around
        We went over there on that side of town
        And we broke into that gas station and we robbed the cash register
        And just at that time we're making our escape
        Here come a policeman walking up the street
        He yelled "Halt!" and we got scared we threw the money up in the air
        We started running and he started too
        He's hollering "halt!" and then he began to shoot.
        I was lucky I got over a fence
        My other friend made it around the corner,
        but my other buddy he went down

        And Michael you should have stopped when the man told you
        Because if that bullet wouldn't have hit you
        You would have been living and what I'm trying to say now
        Is that if you find yourself in a situation
        Where you could get killed or you could live, Live if you cried

        Cause Michael went down by the old man's bullet
        He didn't have to go down if he were to stop
        We had some pride wouldn't let him quit that runnin'
        But now Michael's in the ground.
        Michael why did you keep on runnin'?
        Michael your pride done got you killed
        You should have knowed that cop had a pistol on his side
        Why didn't you stop before you was killed?


        The Race Is On  [D.Rollins]

               G
        I feel tears welling up from down deep inside,
                C                 G
        Like my heart's got a big break.
                                                       A            D
        And a stab of loneliness sharp and painful that I may never shake.

        G
        You might think that I'm taking it hard
                  C                   G
        Since you broke me off with a call,
                  G
        You might wager that I'll hide in sorrow
              D                        G
        And I might lay right down and bawl.

        [Chorus]
                        G
        Now the race is on and here comes pride up the back stretch,
       C
        Heartaches a goin' to the inside,
       G                          A              D
        My tears are holding back, tryin' not to fall.

        G
        My heart's out of the running,
                  C                       G
        True love scratched for another's sake,
                    G
        The race is on and it looks like heartaches,
                D            G
        And the winner loses all.

        [Jam]

        One day I ventured in love never once suspecting
        What the final result would be.
        Now I live in fear of waking up each morning,
        And finding that you're gone from me.

        There's an aching pain in my heart
        For the name of the one that I hated to face,
        Someone else came out to win her, and I came out in second place.

        [Chorus]
        [Jam]
        [Chorus]

                       G
        And the race is on and looks like heartaches,
                D            G   C D G
        And the winner loses all.


        Rain  [?]

        Here I am, on the lam ready to go
        Brighter days have hurried me along, nobody's wrong
        Love stays the same a heart's not to blame nothing is over
        Now it don't worry me at all there's just got to be
        Some kind of overflow nobody falls

        People, we cry, when wells go dry it threatens tomorrow
        Try and find some ways to ease the fright burn into the night
        But maybe a little rain would soothe the pain and drown our sorrows
        And looking straight at all that lives again
        Until we get our fill of overflows, nobody  knows

        In search of love, the seasons above have taken to wander
        Unlike the ones we used to know, where did they go?
        Well, here I am, on the lam, low overflow
        Brighter days have hurried me along
        To see the rain come shinning through, nobody's blue

        Oh seagull, tis an hour of plight
        Energy from your wing helps bring the rain
        Call on your brotherhood of flight and let it rain all nights
        Oh sky lookin clear and bright, Moon, with your own true light
        Turn the tides and rain all night, Turn the tides and rain all night.

        You tell me that it's evolution, well you know
        We all want to change the world

        Don't you know that you can count me out
        Don't you know it's gonna be alright, alright, alright.

        You say you got a real solution, well you know,
        We'd all love to see the plan
        You ask me for a contribution, well you know,
        We are doing what we can
        But if you want money for people with minds that hate
        All I can tell you brother is you have to wait
        Don't you know it's gonna be alright, alright, alright.

        You say you'll change the constitution, well you know
        We all want to change your head
        You tell me it's the institution, well you know
        You better free your mind instead

        Halfway past cool on Monday for the sight of her
        Rode in town while he built afar with the riders and then the poor
        Hot damn, it's a mother's day, don't you all look fine
        Promenading down long car ocean,
        Yes it's mine and it's sniffing white

        They got poets, shuckers and godzilla's 'round
        Mother's sweet little frozen no suit
        We got Speed Racer and his archaic as words Revolutionary Hamstrung
        Blues

        Bringin' all the mares hide in your cabs, honey now loosen your load
        You belong to this has-no-name, what I
        I remember some chicks from the sciz
        Would come along and sit and squeeze too
        Silly says, I say it once, for you it's cold steel and slow
        It's sounds have all ruptured, it sounds just like glass
        Suspect out in the corners, sounding verse and kickin' ass
        I felt the city have a narly, don't make the 6 o'clock news
        Speed Racer and the band here playing

        As I recall I went for the window, but I never did get me there
        Hit me hard with his hickory stick was the last thing I saw, met you
        Drag me down and tangle, you carry the charges if you feel
        Pray for the day that one yourself, but then figure we'll lick a few

        But when I try to look up, don't want to let me loosen your load
        Here alone take this grenade for me, well I

        The fore runner radiates wild help up far now, gun ships pass so far
        Pass me a vote, silly, and how we did it all over
        Did it all over, did it all over the road

        We got broads, suckers and guys in this jail
        Mother sweet little frozen no suit
        We got Speed Racer and his archaic am
        Words Revolutionary Hamstrung Blues


        Rhapsody In Red  [Kahn/Garcia/Hunter]

        I love to hear that Rhapsody in Red
        It just knocks me right outa my head
        Lifts me up here just floatin' around
        Sends me way up and it don't let down

        I love to hear that Rhapsody in Red
        On my feet or laid back in my bed
        Takes me way back where I don't mind
        Takes me way back in my time, in my time

        Sail away on that Rhapsody in Red
        Don't care where those other rainbows led
        With all those Northern lights just blowin' away
        Got no thought to relate in the same old way, anyway

        Love to feel it flood down to my soul
        Lovin' feel just like days of old
        I sing blues where has it led
        Gimme some more Rhapsody in Red, in Red


        Ripple  [Garcia/Hunter] (GD1)

        [Intro:
         |G . . .|. . . .|C . . .|. . . .|G . . .|D . . .|C . . Am |G . . .|]

                            G                 C
        If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine
                                                 G
        And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung,
                                              C
        Would you hear my voice come thru the music?
                    G       D  C                 G
        Would you hold it near as it were your own?

        It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken;
        Perhaps they're better left unsung.
        I don't know, don't really care.
        Let there be songs to fill the air.

        [Bridge]
        Am              D                  G                C
        Ripple in still water, when there is no pebble tossed,
            A7         D
        Nor wind to blow.

        Reach out your hand if your cup be empty,
        If your cup is full may it be again.
        Let it be known there is a fountain
        That was not made by the hands of men.

        There is a road, no simple highway,
        Between the dawn and the dark of night,
        And if you go, no one may follow,
        That path is for your steps alone.

        [Bridge]
        Ripple in still water, when there is no pebble tossed,
        Nor wind to blow.

        You who choose to lead must follow,
        But if you fall, you fall alone.
        If you should stand, then who's to guide you?
        If I knew the way I would take you home.

        La dee da da da, la da da da da, da da da da, da da, da da da da da.
        La da da da, la da da da da, la da da da, la da da da da.

        Money, who needs it, let me live a life free and easy
        Put the toothbrush in my hand and let me be a travelling man
        I'm a road runner, I'm a road runner baby,

        Rockin' Pneumonia  [J.Vincent/H.Smith]

        I wanna jump, but I'm afraid I'll fall.
        I wanna holler, but the joint's too small.
        Young Man Rhythym got a hold on me too,
        I got the Rockin' Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu.

        I wanna get in trouble, but that ain't all.
        I wanna kiss her, but the gal's too tall.
        I wanna scream, but that ain't all.
        I wanna kiss her, but the gal's too small.
        I wanna scream, but no one's around.
        My baby's loving, Lord, she's carrying on.


        Rosalie McFall  [Bill Monroe]

        [Intro: |E . . .|E . . .|C#m . . .|E . . .|C#m . . .|E . . .|
                |E . B .|E . . .|E . . .| ]

        Out on the lonely hillside, in a cabin low and small
        Lived the sweetest rose of color, my Rosalie McFall.
        Her eyes were bright and shining, and her voice was sweet to me
        Knew that I would always love her, and I hoped that she loved me

        [Jam]

        My eyes turned to me my darlin', and this is what she said:
        You know that I would always love you, when you and I are wed.
        Then God way up in heaven, one day for her did call
        I lost my bride oh how I loved her, my Rosalie McFall

        [Jam]

        I searched this wide world over, through cities great and small
        But I never found another, like my Rosalie McFall.

        [Jam]

        Out on the lonely hillside, in a cabin low and small
        Lived the sweetest rose of color, my Rosalie McFall.


        Rosemary  [Garcia/Hunter/Lesh]

        Swath of heaven, a breath of cologne.
        From here was a window, she sat quite alone.
        All around her the garden grew,
        Scarlet and purple and crimson and blue.

        She came and she looked and at last went away.
        The garden was sealed when the flowers decayed.
        On the wall of the garden a legend did say:
        No one may come here since no one may stay.


        Row Jimmy  [Garcia/Hunter] (GDA,GD2)

        Rubin and Cherise  [Garcia/Hunter]

        [Intro:  B F# E    B F# E F#  ]

            B       F#           E         B      F#
        Cherise was brushing her long hair gently down.
                   F#   B          F# E                     B      F#
        It was the afternoon of carni-val as she brushes it gently down.
        B         F#            E       B    F#
        Rubin was strumming his painted mandolin.
                 F#          B           F# E
        It was inlaid with a pretty face in jade.
                   B    F#    E
        Played the Carnival Parade.

        Cherise was dressing as Pirouette in white.
        When a fatal vision gripped her tight. Cherise beware tonight.
        Rubin, Rubin tell me truly true,
        I feel afraid and I don't know why I do.
        Is there another girl for you?

        [Bridge]
        E                   F#    E         B
        If you could see my heart you would know it's true.
        B            Bsus4    B          A               Ab  C#m  Ab
        There's none Cherise, except for you, except for you.
            E           F#         B                     F#        E
        I'd swear to it on my very soul, If I lie, may I fall down cold.

        | E E E E | E E E E | F#

        When Rubin played on his painted mandolin,
        The breeze would pause to listen in before going its way again.
        Masquerade began when nightfall finally woke.
        Like waves against the bandstand, dancers broke,
        To the painted mandolin

        [Bridge]
        Looking out to the crowd, who is standing there?
        Sweet Ruby Claire at Rubin stared, at Rubin stared.
        She was dressed as Pirouette in red,
        And her hair hung gently down.

        | E E E E | E E E E | F#

        The crowd pressed round, Ruby stood as though alone.
        Rubin's song took on a different tone and he played it just for her.
        The song he played was the carnival parade.
        Each note cut a thread of Cherise's fate it cut through like a blade.

        Rubin was playing his painted mandolin.
        When Ruby froze and turned to stone for the strings played all alone.
        The voice of Cherise from the face of the mandolin,
        Singing Rubin, Rubin tell me true, for I have no one but you.

        [Bridge]
        If you could see my heart you would know it true.
        There's none Cherise, except for you, except for you.
        I'd swear to it on my very soul, If I lie, may I fall down cold.

        | E E E E | E E E E | F#

        The truth of love an unsung song must tell.
        The course of love must follow blind without a look behind.
        Rubin walked the streets of New Orleans till dawn.
        Cherise so lightly in his arms and her hair hung gently down.

        [B F# F# E]


        Run for the Roses  [Garcia/Hunter]

        [Chorus]
        A    D    A   G                  A          G
        Run, run, run for the roses, the quicker it opens,
            D
        The sooner it closes.
        A       G       D               A        G             A
        Man, oh man, oh friend of mine, all good things in all good time.

       E              A                      D   A E A
        Reach for the sun, catch hold of the moon.
       E                 A                       D A E A
        They're both too heavy, but what can you do.
     F#m              E                     D  A E A
        Reach for the stars, smack into the sky.
       E                  A                          D
        You don't want to live but you're chicken to die.
        F#m        E          D
        Oh, you're chicken to die.

        [Chorus]

        Run for the money, caught short on the rent.
        Big ideas, but the cash is all spent.
        The trouble with love is its other face.
        You just want the cup, but you don't want the race.
        No, you don't want the race.

        [Chorus]
        [Jam on verse and chorus chords]

        Reach for the rose, get caught on the briar.
        You're warming to love, next thing there's a fire.
        You got the Do Re, I got the Mi.
        I got the notion, we're all at sea.
        Yes, we're all at sea.

        [Chorus] 3x

        A         G                  A
        All goods things in all good time.


        Run, Rudolph Run  [C.Berry]

        Out of all the reindeer you know you're the mastermind
        Run, run Rudolph, Randalph's not too far behind
        Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
        Randalph he can hurry, he can take the freeway down
        And away went Rudolph a whizzing like a merry-go-round

        Said Santa to a boy child "What have you been longing for?"
        "All I want for Christmas is a Rock and Roll electric guitar"
        And away went Rudolph a whizzing like a shooting star

        Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
        Can't you make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
        And away went Rudolph a whizzing like a merry-go-round

        Said Santa to a girl child "What would you like most to get?"
        "I want a little baby doll that can cry, scream and wet"
        And away went Rudolph a whizzing like a Saber jet

        Run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph, a running like a son-of-a-gun.


        Russian Lullaby  [I.Berlin]

        Every night, the air cool, a Russian lullaby,
        Just a plain little tune, when baby starts to cry.

        A land that's free for you and me, and a Russian lullaby.

        (E)          A       C#m       G             Bm E
        This must be heaven, tonight I cross the line.
                        A        C#m             G       Bm E
        You must be the angel, I thought I might never find.
                           A      G                         F#m  Bm
        Was it you I heard singing, Oh while I was chasin' dreams.
                      F#m Bm                          F#m   Bm
        Driven by the wind, like the dust that blows around,
                                 A G D       E          A G D
        And the rain fallin' down,     but I never know.
        E         A             C#m              G       Bm   E
        Got to be heaven, cause here's where the rainbow ends.
                          A                     C#m      G         Bm   E
        If this ain't the real thing, then it's close enough to pretend.
                  A         G                            F#m Bm
        When that wind blows, when the night's about to fall.
                                  F#m Bm                         F#m  Bm
        You can hear the silence call,   it's a certain sort of sound,
                                   F (climb)
        Like the rain fallin' down.

        Odds against me been increasin', but I'll pull through.

        And I don't know what the weather might do.
                  E                    D       A        B
        Hear that witch wind whine and see the dog star shine,
                D                          Bb               A
        I got a feeling there's no time to lose, no time to lose.

        I never know. I don't never know, know, know.

        Well it's been heaven, but even the rainbows will end.
               A                         C#m     G
        Now my sails are fillin' and the wind is willin'.
                   Bm            E
        And I'm as good as gone again.
                  A      G                        F#m   Bm
        I'm still walkin', so I'm sure that I can dance.
                              F#m   Bm                  F#m    Bm
        Just a Saint of Circumstance, just a tiger in a trance.

        And the rain fallin' down, (rain fallin' down now).

        Well, I never know now. Just don't know. Just don't know.
        Listen, sure don't know what I going for, (just don't never know).
        But I'm gonna go for it for sure. (maybe goin' on a dream).

        Samba In The Rain    [Vince Welnick and Robert Hunter]

        Ten and ten is thirty
        if you tell me it is so
        Let's get down and dirty, baby              
        Let's get sweet and low

        Any way you call the shot
        That's how it's gonna be
        You can serve it cold or hot
        It's all okay by me

        Tie me up with ribbon bow
        Wrap me in cellophane
        Send me out to steal the show
        or Samba in the rain

        Samba in the rain oh baby
        Samba in the rain
        Let's get down and dirty
        Don't bother to explain
        Don't care if they call a cop
        and say we are insane
        we'll keep goin' til we drop
        Samba in the rain

        How many hours in a day
        They tell me twenty four
        There could be a couple less
        I know it aint no more

        We can do the dirty bop
        The Darktown Strutter's Ball
        Just as long as we don't stop
        We'll dance right up the wall

        We can do the bump and grind
        The Apache in Spain
        We can do the never mind
        or Samba in the rain



        The Same Thing  [W.Dixon]

        What makes a man go crazy when a woman wears her dress so tight
        What makes a man go crazy when a woman wears that ol' dress so tight
        Must be the same ol' thing that make a tom cat fight all night

        Now, why do all the big men try to run a big-legged woman down
        Now, why do all the big men try to run a big ol' woman down
        Must be the same ol' thing that makes a bulldog a huggling 'round

        It's that ol' same thing, now tell me who's to blame
        The whole world is fighting about that ol' same thing

        What make you feel so good when your baby's in her evening gown
        When your baby get a little bit of an evening gown
        Must be that same ol' thing that makes a preacher lay his bible down

        It's that ol' same thing, it's that ol' same thing


        Samson and Delilah  [Traditional]

        G    F   F# G  C         G7   C        C#       G7
        If I had my way, I would tear this old building down.

             G
        Well Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair,
                                           D          G
        She had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair.
        G
        Delilah she gained old Samson's mind.
                                               D           G
        When first he saw this woman, it could be the last time.
        G
        Delilah she sat down on Samson's knee,
                                               D       G
        Said, "Tell me where your strength lies if you please."
            G
        She spoke so kind, God knows, she talked so fair,
                                       C      G
        Samson said, "Delilah, you cut off my hair.
                G
        You can shave my head, clean as my hand
                                                  C       G
        And my strength will become as natural as any old man.

        G    F   F# G         C      G         F   F# G   F C
        If I had my way, if I had my way, if I had my way,
                G7   C        C#       G7
        I would tear this old building down."

        You read about Samson, all from his works,
        He was the strongest man that ever had lived on earth.
        One day when Samson was walking along,
        Looked down on the ground, he saw an old jawbone.

        He stretched out his arm, God knows, chains broke like thread,
        When he got to moving, ten thousand was dead.

        If I had my way, if I had my way, if I had my way,
        I would tear this old building down.

        [Jam on intro]

        Now Samson and the lion, they got in a tack,
        Samson he crawled up on the lion's back.
        You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws,
        But Samson got his hands up around that lion's jaws.

        And he ripped that beast, God knows he killed him dead.
        And the bees made honey in the lion's head.

        If I had my way, if I had my way, if I had my way,
        I would tear this old building down.


        Satisfaction  [Richards/Jagger]

        I can't get no, satisfaction. I can't get no satisfaction.
        Cause I try and I try and I try and I try.
        I can't get no, I can't get no.

        When I'm driving in my car and that man comes on the radio
        And he's telling me more and more about some useless information
        Supposed to fire my imagination
        I can't get no, Oh, no, no, no.  Hey, hey, hey, that's what I say.
        When I'm watching my TV and that man comes on
        To tell me how white my shirts (?)
        Well he can't be a man
        'Cause he doesn't smoke the same cigarettes as me

        When I'm riding 'round the world
        And I'm doin' this and I'm signin' that
        And I'm trying to make some girl
        Who tells me, baby maybe come back later next week
        Cause you see I'm on a losing streak


        Save the Whales  [?]

        When my grandpa was a boy, he went down to the general store.
        Saw a picture book of whales,
        Shootin' his spout and flashin' his tail.
        Then he go, a sailor's dream, cruisin' around on the salty sea.
        Joinin' up with a fisher crew go out and get him a whale or two.
        Tell me what kind of men are these that sail upon the salty seas.
        Lovin' and drinkin' in the afternoon,
        Swabbin' the deck and sharpnin' harpoons.

        Hooray, up she rises. Hooray, up she rises.  Hooray, up she rises.
        So early in the morning.

        Lots of whales in the deep blue sea, we kill them for the companies.
        Drag 'em alongside and chop 'em in two,
        Melt them down and sail it to you.
        There hardly is a sailor alive, who can keep a tear from his eye.
        Cause he remembers the good old days
        When there were no whales to save.
        Thank the Russians and the Japanese for scouring the deep, blue sea.
        Lookin' for ivory and perfume, all the light you'll ever need.

        Hooray, up she rises.  Hooray, up she rises.  Hooray, up she rises.
        So early in the morning.

        Shanghi got a lot on the move,
        Put out from Boston in the middle of June.
        Thirty-six months out at sea is nothing but death and misery.
        Set off on a three year cruise, Union ship and a Union crew.
        And after six months he began to see, whalin' not what it used to be.
        A modern ship and a modern crew, occalascopes and explodin' harpoons.
        A mechanical boat made of steel,
        A floatin' machine just to kill all the whales.

        Hooray, up she rises.  Hooray, up she rises.  Hooray, up she rises.
        So early in the mornin'.

        When my grandpa was a boy, he went down  to the general store.

        Sawmill  [?]

        Once I was a slave at the sawmill
        Talk about a poor boy, talk about a poor boy

        Talk about a poor boy, talk about a poor boy
        Let me have a dollar bill

        See my teardrops falling down my  wife left this sawmill town
        She said sawmill's life had been a sin
        The gravy were much too thin
        I can't work no more at the sawmill
        Talk about a poor boy, talk about a poor boy
        Let me have a dollar bill

        If you take your wife to the sawmill
        How you gonna please her, how you gonna please her
        When she wants a dollar bill
        She'll run away and leave you at the sawmill
        Women like a dollar, women like a dollar.  Yes and women always will.

              E                                    B
        Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air.

        From the other direction, she was calling my eye;

        It could be an illusion, but I might as well try, might as well try.

        She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes,
        And I knew without askin' she was into the blues.
        She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls;
        I knew right away she was not like other girls, other girls.

        In the heat of the evening when the dealing got rough,
        She was too pat to open and too cool to bluff.
        As I picked up my matches and was closing the door,
        I had one of those flashes I'd been there before, been there before.

        [Bridge]
                F#
        Well, I ain't often right but I've never been wrong;
        B                           A           E
        Seldom turns out the way it does in the song.
        F#
        Once in a while you get shown the light
               B                           A         |E . . .|. . . .|
        In the strangest of places, if you look at it right.

        |F# . . .|. . . .|A . . .|. . . .|B . . .|. . . .|. . . .|. . . .|

        Well there ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves,
        Or scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues.
        And there's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eye;
        I had to learn the hard way to let her pass by, let her pass by.

        The wind in the willow's playin' "Tea for Two";
        The sky was yellow and the sun was blue.

        Everybody is playing in the heart of gold band, heart of gold band.

        Searchin'  [J.Leiber/M.Stoller]

        Well, I've been searchin', I've been searchin'
        I've been searchin' every week and day
        Well, I've been searchin', I've been searchin'

        Well, if I have to climb a mountain, you know I will
        And if I have to swim a river, you know I will

        No matter where she goes, Oh Lord, you know I will
        And if I have to climb a mountain, you know I will
        And if I have to swim a river, you know I will
        I know she's hiding up there
        If you marry him don't you know I'll find her, child I will

        Well Sherlock Holmes, Sam Spade gonna put that child on me
        No matter where she's hiding
        She gonna tell me you're coming
        I'm gonna walk right down that street just like bulldog jumping
        Cause I've been searchin', I've been searchin'
        I've been searchin' every which way
        Like the North West Mountain you know I'll bring her in someday


        I Second That Emotion  [S.Robinson/A.Cleveland]

        A
        Maybe you'd like to give me kisses sweet
        Only for one night with no repeat.
        Maybe you'd go away and never call.
                D                E                  A

                       A      D  [Intro]

        Maybe you think that love will tie you down.
        You ain't got the time to hang around.
        Maybe you think that love will make a fool.
        And so it makes you wise to break the rules.

        Ship of Fools  [Garcia/Hunter] (GDA,GD2)

        Went to see the captain, strangest I could find,
        Laid my proposition down, laid it on the line.
        I won't slave for beggar's pay, likewise gold and jewels,
        But I would slave to learn the way to sink your ship of fools.

        Ship of fools on a cruel sea, ship of fools sail away from me.
        It was later than I thought when I first believed you,
        Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools.

        Saw your first ship sink and drown, from rockin' of the boat,
        And all that could not sink or swim was just left there to float.
        I won't leave you drifting down, but woh it makes me wild,
        With thirty years upon my head to have you call me child.

        Ship of fools on a cruel sea, ship of fools sail away from me.
        It was later than I thought when I first believed you,
        Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools.

        The bottles stand as empty, as they were filled before.
        Time there was and plenty, but from that cup no more.
        Though I could not caution all, I still might warn a few:
        Don't lend your hand to raise no flag atop no ship of fools.

        Ship of fools on a cruel sea, ship of fools sail away from me.
        It was later than I thought, when I first believed you,
        Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools.

        It was later than I thought when I first believed you,
        Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools.

        Simple Twist Of Fate  [Dylan]

       D                             F#m
        They sat together in the park   as the evening sky grew dark
      Am                                     G
        She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones
      G7                       D                          G
        Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
       D                     A                D
        And watched out for a simple twist of fate

        They walked along by the old canal, a little confused I remember well
        And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin' bright
        He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train
        Moving with a simple twist of fate

        [Jam]

        A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walkin' by the arcade
        As the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin' up
        She dropped a coin into the cup of the blind man at the gate
        And forgot about a simple twist of fate

        He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere
        He told himself he didn't care pushed the window open wide
        Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate
        Brought on by a simple twist of fate

        [Jam]

        He hears the ticking of the clocks
        And walks along with a parrot that talks
        Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in
        Maybe she'll pick him out again, how long must he wait
        Once more for a simple twist of fate

        People tell me it's a sin, to know and feel too much within
        I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring
        She was born in the spring, but I was born too late
        Blame it on a simple twist of fate
        Blame it on a simple twist of fate.

        Sitting here in limbo, like a bird without a song.
        Well they're putting up resistance, but I know
        that my faith will lead me on.

        Sitting here in limbo, waiting for the dice to roll.
        Sitting here in limbo, got some time to search my soul.
        Well they're putting up resistance but I know
        that my faith will lead me on.
        I don't know where life will lead me, but I know where I've been.
        I can't say what life will show me, but I know what I've seen.
        Tried my hand at love and friendship,
        But all that is passed and gone.
        This little boy is moving on.

        Sitting here in limbo waiting for the tide to flow.
        Sitting here in limbo knowing that I have to go.
        Well they're putting up resistance, but I know
        that my faith will lead me on.
        Sitting in limbo.

        Smokestack Lightnin'  [Chester Burnette]

        Oh, smokestack lightnin', shinin' just like gold
        Why can't you hear me cryin'? Ooooo
        Oh, stop your train, let a hobo ride
        Why can't you hear me cryin'? Ooooo

        Oh, fare you well, I never see you no more
        Why can't you hear me cryin'? Ooooo

        Oh, stop your train, let a poor boy ride, callin' yes I do
        Let a poor boy ride, let his foot step on

        A little pretty boy?  Tell me all ooooh

 
        So Many Roads  [Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter]

 
        Thought I heard a blackbird singing up on a bluebird hill
        Call me a whining boy if you will
        Born where the sun don't shine
        And I don't deny my name
        No place to go, ain't that a shame.
 
        Thought I heard that KC whistle moaning sweet and low
        Thought I heard that KC when she blow
        Down where the sun don't shine
        Underneath the Kokomo
        Whining boy ain't got no place to go.
 
        So many roads I tell you,
        So many roads I know
        So many roads, so many roads.
        Mountain high, river wide,
        So many roads to ride
        So Many roads, so many roads.
 
        Thought I heard a jug band playing
        If you don't who else will
        From over on the far side of the hill
        All I know the sun don't shine
        And the rain refuse to fall
        You don't seem to hear me when I call.
 
        Wind inside and the wind outside
        Tangled in a window blind
        Tell me why you treat me so unkind
        Down where the sun don't shine
        Lonely and I call your name
        No place else to go ain't that a shame.
 
        New York to San Francisco, so many roads I know
        All I want is one to take me home
        High road to the low road, so many roads I know
        So many roads, so many roads.
 
        From the land of the midnight sun
        Where the ice blue roses grow
        Along those roads of gold and silver snow
        Howling wide or moaning low
        So many roads I know
        So many roads to ease my soul
        So many roads to ease my soul



        Spoonful  [Willie Dixon]

        Could have been a spoonful of coffee
        Could have been a spoonful of tea
        Just a little spoon of your precious love is good enough for me
        Man lies about that, man cries about that
        Man dies about that, spoonful, spoonful, spoonful

        Could have been a spoonful of water
        Spread out on the desert sand
        Just a little spoon fortifies, save you from another man
        Man lies about that, man cries about that
        Even dies about that, spoonful, spoonful, spoonful

        Could have been a spoonful of diamonds
        Could have been a spoonful of gold
        Just a little spoon of your precious love to satisfy my soul

        Everybody's talking about spoonful
        Spoonful, spoonful, spoonful
        Everybody's fighting about spoonful

        Standing on the Moon  [Garcia/Hunter]

        Standing on the moon, got no caprin' on my shoe.
        Standing on the moon, I'm feeling so blue.

        See the gulf of Mexico, as silent as a tear.
        The coast of California, must be somewhere over here,
        Over here.

        Standing on the moon, I see the battle rage below.
        Standing on the moon, I see the soldiers come and go.

        There's a metal plate beside me, someone planted long ago.
        Those colors standing stiffly, crimson, white, and indigo.
        Oh, roaring, standing stiffly, crimson, white, and indigo,
        Indigo.

        Standing on the moon, I can see a silver door.
        I hear the cries of children, and other songs of war.

        It's like a mighty melody, which wings out from the sky.
        Standing here upon the moon, I watch it all roll by,
        All roll by, all roll by, all roll by.

        Standing on the moon, I see a shadow on the sun.
        Standing on the moon, the stars go fading one by one.

        I can hear a cry of victory, another of defeat.
        A staff on angel lullaby, down some forgotten street.

        Standing on the moon, where talk is cheap, and vision true.
        Standing on the moon, but I would rather be with you.

        Somewhere in San Francisco, on a back porch in July.
        Just looking up to heaven, at this crescent in the sky,
        In the sky.

        Standing on the moon, with nothing left to do.
        A lonely view of heaven, but I'd rather be with you.
        A lonely view of heaven, but I'd rather be with you,
        Be with you, be with you, be with you, be with you,
        Rather be with you, be with you, be with you, be with you.


        Stealin'  [Gus Cannon]

        Well, put your arms around me like a circle in the sun
        Stay with me baby like my easy rider done

        If you don't think I love you look what a fool I've been
        If you don't think I'm sinking look what a hole I'm in

        I'm stealin' pretty mama don't you tell on me
        I'm stealin' back my good old used-to-be

        Well, the woman I love she's about my size
        She's a married woman, comes to see me sometimes


        Stella Blue  [Garcia/Hunter] (GDA,GD2)

       E                 Emaj7 Asus4                 A
        All the years combine,      they melt into a dream,
      Em               C7           B7
        A broken angel sings from a guitar.
       E                          Emaj7 Asus4                    A
        In the end there's just a song,      comes cryin' up the night
      Em                       C7                  B7
        Through all the broken dreams and vanished years.
               E    A        E
        Stella Blue.  Stella Blue.

        When all the cards are down, there's nothing left to see,
        There's just the pavement left and broken dreams.
        In the end there's still that song comes cryin' like the wind.
        Down every lonely street that's ever been
        Stella blue. Stella blue.

        [Bridge]
       B                               E            A E                B
        I've stayed in every blue-light cheap hotel,   can't win for trying.
                                         E    A     E   A
        Dust off those rusty strings just one more time,
       E                B
        Gonna make them shine (shine).

        [Jam on verse chords, omit second Emaj7]

        It all rolls into one and nothing comes for free,
        There's nothing you can hold, for very long.
        And when you hear that song come crying like the wind,
        It seems like all this life was just a dream.
        Stella Blue. Stella Blue.
        Stella Blue. Stella Blue. |E . . .|A . . .| repeat


        Stuck Inside of Mobile (With The Memphis Blues Again)  [Dylan]

        Ah the rag man draws circles up and down the block.
        I'd ask him what the matter was and ah did he dum talk.
        And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnished me with tea.
        But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
        Oh mama, can this really be the end.
        To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again.

        Well Shakespeare he's in the ally
        With his pointed shoes and his bells
        Speaking to some french girl who says she knows me well.
        And I would send a message to find out if she'd talked.
        But the post office has been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
        Oh mama, can this really be the end.
        To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again.

        Mona tried to tell me to stay away from the train line.
        She said that all the railroad men
        Just drink up your blood like wine.
        And I said oh I didn't know that,
        But then again there's only one I've met.
        And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette.
        Oh mama, can this really be the end.
        To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again.

        Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks.
        And everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
        But me I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control.
        When he build a fire on Main street and shot it full of holes.
        Oh mama, can this really be the end.
        To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again.

        Now the senator came down here, showing everyone his gun.
        Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
        And me I nearly got busted. And wouldn't it be my luck.
        To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath the truck.
        Ah mama, is this really the end.
        To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again.

        Now the teen preacher looked so baffled
        When I asked him why he'd dressed,
        With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
        But he cursed me when I proved to him,
        Then I whispered said that not even you can hide.
        You see you're just like me I hope your satisfied.
        Oh mama, can this really be the end.
        To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again.

        Now the rainman gave me two cures, then he said jump right in.
        The one was Texas medicine, the other was just railroad gin.
        And like a fool I mixed them, and it strangled up my mind,
        And people just get uglier, and I have no sense of time.
        Oh mama, can this really be the end.
        To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again.

        When Ruthie says come see her in her honky tonk lagoon.
        Where I can watch her waltz for free neath a Panamanian moon.
        And I say ah come on now, you know you know about my debutantes.
        She says your debutante knows what you need,
        But I knows what you want

        Oh mama, can this really be the end.
        To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again.

        Now the bricks lay on Grand street. Where the neon madmen climb.
        They all fall there so perfectly. It all seems so well timed.
        And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out past.
        You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
        Ah mama, is this really the end.
        To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again.



        Strugglin' Man    [Jimmy Cliff]

        Every man has the right to live.
        Love is all he has to give.
        Together we struggle by the will to survive.
        Together we fight just to stay alive.

        CHORUS:
        Strugglin' man has got to move.
        Strugglin' man has got no time to lose.
        I'm a strugglin' man and I got to move on.

        The sun lights the day and the moon lights the night.
        Strugglin' man keeps reachin' for the higher heights.
        So we plan for tomorrow as we live for today.
        Like the flowers we bloom and then later fade away.

        CHORUS

        The sun lights the day and the moon lights the night.
        Strugglin' man keeps reachin' for the higher heights.
        So we plan for tomorrow as we live for today.
        Like the flowers we bloom and then later fade away.

        [Chorus]
        |B . . .|E . . .| 24x [long]

        Well in spite of all you gained,
        You still have to stand out in the pouring rain.
        One last voice is calling you, and I guess it's time you go.

        [Chorus]
        |B . . .|E . . .| 4x

        Well, shake it up now, Sugaree; I'll meet you at the jubilee,
        And if that jubilee don't come, maybe I'll meet you on the run.

        [Chorus]
        Shake it, shake it, Sugaree; just don't tell them that you know me.
       B                   E       C#m                             A  E B
        Shake it, shake it, Sugaree; just don't tell them that you know me.

        Sunrise  [Donna Godchaux] (GDA)

        Gazing at the fire, burning by the water
        Before he speaks the world around us quiets.

        With eyes as sharp as arrows and turning to the fire
        He clears the air and cuts it with a feather.

        Many in a circle slowly 'round the fire
        When he is gone I want to know him better.

        No one is forsaken, no one is a liar,
        He plants the tree of life on our foreheads with water.

        He hums, there are drums, four winds, rising suns,
        We are singing and playing, I her him saying.

        I remember breezes from winds inside your body
        Keep me high, like I told you,
        I'll sing to them this story and know why.


        Supplication  [Weir/Barlow]

        Well, dizzy ain't the word for the way that you're making me feel now
        Well, I need some indication, girl,
        If all of this is real now, tell me girl now

        Well, I've heard it said there's something wrong in my head, now
        Got to help me, girl, now
        Could it be infatuation or am I just being misled now?

        Little bolt of inspiration Way you strike me now
        Sparking my imagination, got the lightning now
        Cause me such excitation, got the lightning now
        'Bout to end my suffocation, come on strike me now
        Little bolt of inspiration
        Way you strike me now, she's back in my imagination

        Wond'rin if she'd changed at all if her hair was still red.

        Gettin' through - Tangled up in blue.

        She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced.
        I helped her out of a jam, I guess,but I used a little too much force
        We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out West.
        Split up on a dark sad night both agreeing it was best.
        She turned around to look at me as I was walkin' away.
        I heard her say over my shoulder, We'll meet again someday
        On the avenue - Tangled up in blue.

        I had a job in the great north woods working as a cook for a spell.
        But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell.
        So I drifted down to New Orleans where I happened to be employed.
        Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat right outside of Delacroix.
        But all the while I was alone the past was close behind,
        I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind.
        And I just grew - Tangled up in blue.

        She was workin' in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer.
        I just kept lookin' at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear
        And later on as the crowd thinned out, I's just about to do the same.
        She was standing there in back of my chair
        Said to me, "Don't you know my name?"
        I muttered somethin' under my breath
        She studied the lines on my face,
        I must admit I felt a little uneasy, when she bent down to tie the
        Laces of my shoe - tangled up in blue.

        She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
        "I thought you'd never say hello," she said.
        "You look like the silent type."
        Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
        Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century.
        And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burnin' coal,
        Pourin' off of every page like it was written in my soul
        From me to you - Tangled up in blue.

        I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs.
        There was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air.
        Then he started into dealing with slaves, & something inside him died
        She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside.
        And when finally the bottom fell out I became withdrawn
        The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keepin' on
        Like a bird that flew - Tangled up in blue.

        So now I'm goin' back again I got to get to her somehow.
        All the people we used to know they're an illusion to me now.
        Some are mathematicians some are carpenter's wives,
        Don't know how it all got started
        I don't know what they're doin' with their lives.
        But me, I'm still on the road, headin' for another joint.
        We always did feel the same we, just saw it from another point
        Of view - Tangled up in blue.


        Tastebud     [?]

        Woke up way after midnight, people
        Just a little while, a little while before day
        I could find no satisfaction
        Turned my pillow to where my baby lay
        I knew I was in a strange old town then
        My sweet little angel she's so far away

        Ain't got no, no good place to go
        All my friends are back home
        And I can't, I can't go there no more
        You know I done just a little bit wrong
        And I can't go back no more

        Take me back baby
        I can't help it if I need you so
        Well I've been a bad man darling

        She'd embarrass you anywhere,

        Had another man kick you out the door,
        now that same dude is wearing your clothes

        Tell your Mama, what you want, tell your Mama, what you need
        Tell your Mama, what you got to have

        Terrapin Station - Lady With a Fan  [Garcia/Hunter] (GDA)

        [Intro: F]

        G                  Dm            C         G       F
        Let my inspiration flow in token rhyme, suggesting rhythm,
                         C                 F                C    F C Am9 Dm9
        That will not forsake you, till my tale is told and done.
        G                      Dm
        While the firelight's aglow,
                       C            G        F
        Strange shadows from the flames will grow,
                                C                F
        Till things we've never seen will seem familiar.

        Shadows of a sailor, forming winds both foul and fair, all swarm.
        Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady many years ago.
        Here beside him stands a man, a soldier from the looks of him,
        Who came through many fights, but lost at love.

        While the storyteller speaks, a door within the fire creaks;
        Suddenly flies open, and a girl is standing there.
        Eyes alight, with glowing hair, all that fancy paints as fair,
        She takes her fan and throws it, in the lion's den.

        Which of you to gain me, tell, will risk uncertain pains of hell?
        I will not forgive you if you will not take the chance.
        The sailor gave at least a try; the soldier being much too wise,
        Strategy was his strength, and not disaster.

        The sailor, coming out again, the lady fairly leapt at him.
        That's how it stands today. You decide if he was wise.
        The story teller makes no choice. Soon you will not hear his voice.
        His job is to share the light, and not to master.

        In hopes he will come back, but he cannot be bought or sold.

        They Love Each Other  [Garcia/Hunter]

        Mary run around, sailin' up and down,
        G                            C
        Looking for a shot in some direction.

        He could pass his time, around some other line
        But you know he chose this place beside her.
        Don't get in the way, there's nothing you can say,
        Nothing that you need to add or do.

        They love each other. Lord you can see that it's true.
        Lord you can see that it's true. Lord you can see that it's true.

        [Jam]

        It's nothing, they explain, it's like a diesel train.
        You better not be there when it rolls over.
        And when that train rolls in, you wonder where it's been.
        You gotta try to see a little further.

        They love each other. Lord you can see that it's true.
        Lord you can see that it's true. Lord you can see that it's true.
        Lord you can see that it's true. Lord you can see that it's true.

        [ ADDITIONAL LYRICS FROM THE 1973 VERSION ]

        Though you'll make a noise, just can't hear your voice.
        All the dizzy ride on your cold shoulder.

        Won't you believe what I say is true?
        Everything I did I heard it first from you.
        (Everything I tell you, I heard it first from you.)

        Heard your news report, you know you're falling short.
        Pretty soon, we'll trust you for the weather.
        When that ship comes in, you won't know where it's been.
        You got to try to see a little further.


        Think  [?]

        I could give up my friend, I know.
        And in return, you could give up yours.
        If you only think, what would we do later on?
        What kind of life would we have, just in case we both were wrong?

        I give up my woman, you give your man.
        But it don't make sense, to take the chance.
        If you only think, what would we do later on?
        Just in case we both were wrong?


        This Time Forever  [Weir/Barlow]

        We had plenty of lovers, we put in our time
        We were anything but blind
        Just as certain angels of perpetual flight
        When we met we saw the light
        This time for sure, this time forever, but it turned to sand
        Slipping through our hand, as time slipped away

        She was a stranger, just a stranger, when I awoke and saw her face
        She moved in for the winter, made a garden in May
        Summer came and gone, I was gone when she left me
        There was nothing to leave, swept away on a breeze
        This time for sure, this time forever, but it turned to sand
        Slipped right through our hand, as time slipped away
        She was a stranger when I woke and saw her face

      Bm            A                   E                  A
        Picture a bright blue ball just spinning, spinning free,
      Bm      G            A
        Dizzy with eternity.
      Em                                  A                  Em
        Painted with a skin of sky, brush in some clouds and sea.

        Call it home for you and me.

      Bm           A                 E            A
        A peaceful place or so it looks from space

        But afraid, we may our home to waste.

                E               D     A
        Singing ashes, ashes all fall down. Ashes, ashes all fall down.

        Now watch as the ball revolves as the nighttime falls.
        And again the hunt begins and again the blood wind calls.
        By and by again, the morning sun will rise.
        But the darkness never goes from some men's eyes. (Well I know)

        It strolls the sidewalks and it rolls the streets.
        Staking turf, dividing up meat.
        Nightmare spook, piece of heat; you and me, you and me.

        Click flash blade in ghetto night. Rudies looking for a fight.
        Rat cat alley, roll them bones. Need that cash to feed that jones,
        And the politicians throwing stones.
        Singing ashes, ashes all fall down. Ashes, ashes all fall down.

     C#m               A                 E
        Commissars and pin-stripe bosses roll the dice.
      Bm                            A       E             A

        Money green or proletarian gray, selling guns instead of food today.

               E                     D           A
        So the kids they dance, they shake their bones
                E           D           A
        And the politicians throwing stones.
        E                       D     A
        Singing ashes, ashes all fall down. Ashes, ashes all fall down.

      Bm                 A              E             A
        Heartless powers try to tell us what to think.
      Bm                 G                             A
        If the spirit's sleeping, then the flesh is ink. (Yeah)

        History's page, will be neatly carved in stone.
            Bm                               A

        While the politicians are throwing stones
        Singing ashes, ashes all fall down.
        Ashes, ashes all fall down.        (E D A <-- 4 times)

        Shipping powders back and forth.
        Singing "Black goes south while white comes north."
        And the whole world full of petty wars.
        Singing "I got mine and you got yours."
        While the current fashions set the pace,
        Lose your step, fall out of grace.
        The radical he rant and rage,
        Singing "Someone got to turn the page."
        And the rich man in his summer home,
        Singing "Just leave well enough alone."
        But his pants are down, his cover's blown.
        And the politicians throwing stones.
        So the kids they dance they shake their bones.
        'Cause it's all too clear we're on our own.
        Singing ashes, ashes all fall down. Ashes, ashes all fall down.
      Bm          A                     E                  A

        Make yourself easy.

        Till we all fall down, it'll do you fine.

        The way you came or the way you go.
        Let your tracks be lost in the dark and snow.

        When the shadows grow, it'll do you fine.
        When the cold winds blow it'll ease your mind.
        The shape it takes could be yours to choose,
        What you may win, what you may lose.

        To tell sweet lies, one last time, and say goodnight.

        [Chorus]
       G          Bm       Am            D
        To lay me down, oh oh, to lay me down.
       C     Bm Am G     F        C          Bm Am G    F C
        To lay  me down, one last time. To lay  me down.

        Tom Dooley  [Traditional]

        Hang your head, hang your head, Tom Dooley hang your head and cry
        Killed poor Laura Foster, you  know you're bound to die
        Bury her on the hillside, make the people see
        Put the coat over, tromp her with your feet

        Hang your head Tom Dooley, hang your head and cry
        Killed poor Laura Foster, don't you know your bound to die
        Bury her on the hillside with other people's lives
        Hang your head Tom Dooley, hang your head and cry
        Killed poor Laurea Foster, don't you know you're bound to die

        First time I went courting, pretty brave of me
        Just to sing from her old oak tree
        Hang your mama with kindness blame it on this morning


        Tomorrow Is Forever  [Dolly Parton]

        Take my hand and run with me out of the past called yesterday
        and walk with me into the future on to tomorrow
        Yesterday my sweetful life rolled again back no matter what
        There is nothing left but memories that bring sorrows
        Yesterday is gone but tomorrow is forever

        No more cryin' and memories find their way back
        Tomorrow's waiting let's journey there together
        Yesterday is gone but tomorrow is forever

        I care no for yesterday, I love you as you are today
        We must forget the passing time
        My love for you is the real kind of love that won't hurt you forever
        Yesterday is over. tomorrow is forever


        Tom Thumb Blues  [Dylan]

        When your lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter time too
        When your gravity is down and negativity won't pull you through
        Don't you put on any airs when you down on Rue Morgue Avenue.
        They got some hungry creatures there
        They'll surely make a mess out of you

        If you see St Annie, please tell her thanks alot
        My thoughts they are twisted, my tentacles are all in a knot
        I don't even have the strength to get up and take another shot.
        Now my best friend, my drummer,
        Won't even tell what it was that I dropped

        Now sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the goddess of gloom.
        She speaks good English as she invites you up into her room.
        And you, you were so damn conscientious,
        You couldn't go to her too soon
        Still she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.

        Up on Housing Project Hill, it's either fortune or fame
        You must choose one or the other
        Though neither are to be what they claim
        If you're looking to get silly,
        You better get back from where you came
        You know the cops don't need you and we all expect the same.

        Now all the authorities, they just lay around and boast
        About how they blackmailed the President into leaving his post.
        And picking up Angel,
        Who arrived up here from the coast,
        Who looked so fine at first, but left looking like a ghost.

        Now I started out heinakin, still hit the harder stuff
        Everybody swore they stand behind me when the game got rough
        But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to call my bluff
        I'm goin' back to San Enselmo, I do believe I had enough.


        Tons of Steel  [Mydland]

        I know these rails we're on like I know my lady's smile,
        We see a dozen dreams in every passing mile.
        Can't begin to count the trips she and I have made,
        But I wish I had a dollar
        For each time we've both been down this grade.

        And 100,000 tons of steel, made to roll.
        The brakes don't work and this grade's too steep,
        Her engine's sure to blow.
        And 100,000 tons of steel, out of control,
        She's more a rollercoaster than the train I used to know.

        It's one hell of an understatement, to say she can't be beat.
        She's tempermental, more a bitch than a machine.
        She wasn't built to travel at speed or through mud slides.
        These wheels are bound to jump the tracks
        Before they burn like the ties

        And 100,000 tons of steel, made to roll.
        The brakes don't work and this grade's too steep,
        Her engine's sure to blow
        And 100,000 tons of steel, out of control
        She's more a rollercoaster than the train I used to know.

        Murphy sure out done himself to pick this stretch of track
        I can only hope my luck is ridin' in the back.
        Well I have pray to God this ain't the day we meet,
        I've done about everything, but try dragging my feet.

        And 100,000 tons of steel, made to roll.
        The brakes don't work and this grade's too steep,
        Her engine's sure to blow
        And 100,000 tons of steel, out of control,
        She's more a rollercoaster than the train I used to know.

        Oh, oh I want to go down slow.


        Tore Up Over You  [Hank Ballard]

        Ever since you been gone I just cried the whole night long
        Since the day you said goodbye left me sore, no lie, no lie

        Tore up over you, and I just can't find my way.
        Tore up! Yeah, yeah, yeah, tore up.
        Woh-oh-oh tore up!  Yeah, yeah, yeah, tore up.
        Tore up over you, and I just can't find my way.

        Never loved me like ya told me so if you did how could you go?
        It was you, not me, that left and went away with someone else

        Tore up over you, and I just can't find my way.
        Tore up! Yeah, yeah, yeah, tore up.
        Woh-oh-oh tore up!  Yeah, yeah, yeah, tore up.
        Tore up over you, and I just can't find my way.

        Tell me what did I do to make you go away?
        Tell me what can I do to make to come back and stay?

        Tore up over you, and I just can't find my way.
        Tore up! Yeah, yeah, yeah, tore up.
        Woh-oh-oh tore up!  Yeah, yeah, yeah, tore up.
        Tore up over you, and I just can't find my way.


        Touch of Grey  [Garcia/Hunter]

        Must be getting early, clocks are running late.
        Paint-by-number morning sky, looks so phony.
        Dawn is breaking everywhere, light a candle, curse the glare
        Draw the curtains I don't care, but it's alright
        I will get by, I will get by, I will get by, I will survive.

        I see you've got your list out, say your piece and get out.
        Guess I get the jist of it, but it's alright
        Sorry that you feel that way, the only thing I have to say
        Every silver linings got a touch of grey
        I will get by, I will get by, I will get by, I will survive.

        It's a lesson to me, the ables and the bakers and the theives
        The abc's we all think of, try to keep a little love.

        I know the rent is in arrears, the dog has not been fed in years
        It's even worse than it appears, but it's alright

        Cow is giving kerosene, kid can't read at seventeen
        The words he knows are all obscene, but it's alright
        I will get by, I will get by, I will get by, I will survive.

        Shoe is on the hand it fits, that's all there really is to it
        Whistle through your teeth and spit, but it's alright

        Oh well a touch of grey, kinda suits you anyway,
        That's all I had to say, but it's alright
        I will get by, I will get by, I will get by, I will survive.

        It's a lesson to me, the deltas and the East and the freeze
        The abc's we all must face, try to save a little grace.


        Tough Mama  [?]

        [Intro: D Bm A]

       D      Bm   A
        Tough mama, meat shakin' on your bone.
       D    Bm   A
        I'm gone, going down to the river and get you a stone.
      Bm                              A
        I was on the highway with that steel-driving crew.
      Bm                           D       A        G
        Sister's in the big house, working days are through.
       C    G    A
        Oh, mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?

        [Jam]

        Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room.
        It's my duty, to take you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
?       Lay down, but on the right.
        You can see it all the way, down to the sky.
        Oh, beauty, it's a long night's journey in your eyes.

        [Jam]

?       Sweet goddess, I wanna shine and light in the changing wind.
        Don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
?       Deck the cowboy win or north his betting years are past.
        He almost went out drinking, but that was over fast.
        Oh, mama, you cook for strangers coming on in at last.

        [Jam]

?       Smooth angel, imagine a lonesome road with no slee
        I'd be grateful, if this golden ring you could receive.
?       Today on the countryside it was harder than a crotch.
        Stood alone upon a ridge, and all I did was watch.
        Dark beauty, you must give me time to carve another notch.

        [Jam]

        I've just fallen, world of illusions at my door.
        I ain't haulin', any of my limbs through the marketplace anymore.
        Mission walls are crumblin' down there is no end in sight.
        Gained some recognition, but I've lost my appetite.
        Dark beauty, leave me at the corner late tonight.


        Truckin  [Garcia/Weir/Hunter/Lesh] (GDA,GD1)

        E                                     A
        Truckin' got my chips cashed in, keep truckin' like the doo-dah man.
          B                       Bsus4 A                    E
        Together, more or less in line, just keep truckin' on.

        E
        Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street.
        Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street.
        Your typical city involved in a typical daydream,
        Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings.

        Dallas got a soft machine, Houston too close to New Orleans,
        New York got the ways and means, but just won't let you be.

        Most of the cats that you meet on the street speak of true love.
        Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home.
        One of these days they know they gotta get goin'
        Out of the door and down to the street all alone.

        Truckin' like the doo-dah man
        Once told me "You got to play your hand.
        Sometimes the cards ain't worth a dime, if you don't lay 'em down."

        [Bridge]
        A                                      G D A
        Sometimes the lights all shinin' on me,
        A                 D      A   G D A
        Other times I can barely see.

        Lately it occurs to me. What a long, strange trip it's been.

        What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
        She lost her sparkle; you know she isn't the same.
        Livin' on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine,
        All a friend can say is, "Ain't it a shame."

        Truckin' up to Buffalo, been thinkin' you got to mellow slow.
        Takes time, you pick a place to go, just keep truckin' on.

        Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window,
        Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again.
        I'd like to get some sleep before I travel,
        But if you got a warrant I guess you're gonna come in.

        Busted down on Bourbon Street. Set up like a bowlin' pin.
        Knocked down, it get's to wearin' thin, they just won't let you be.

        You're sick of hangin' around, and you'd like to travel.
        Get tired of travelin', you want to settle down.
        I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin',
        Get out of the door, light out and look all around. E F F# G G#

        [Bridge]

        Truckin', I'm a goin' home, whoa, whoa, baby, back where I belong.
        Back home, sit down and patch my bones and get back truckin' on.
        Get back truckin' on. [repeat/adlib]

        Two Souls in Communion  [?]

        What are they seeing, when they look in each other's eyes?
        What are they feeling, when they see each other smile?
        Is it love, I don't know - or an emotion that I've outgrown?

        Did I take a wrong turn - in on life's winding road?
        Won't somebody help me find the right way to go?
        My life need some correction, alteration and direction.
        Wont somebody stand by me - yes, I'm lost, yes, I'm lost,
        Yes, I'm lost.

        What is the secret of this time of mine?
        Two souls in communion, both body and mind.
        Is it special magic, or just the nature of things?
        Come see the great spirit, not for beggars but for kings.

        You who have found it please help me along.
        I'm a man, I'm a man, - I'm not made out of stone.
        My needs they are simple, I don't want anything,
        but I surely want to fly on those wings, on the run, one more time.

        All I wanna do, fly up, fly home.
        Fly on those wings of love, fly up, fly home,
        I'm a staying in your town, fly up, fly home,
        Help me somebody please! Fly up, fly home.

        I wake up early in the morning, fly up, fly home,
        you know I never saw you babe, fly up, fly home.

        I just can't seem to understand,
        can't seem to understand what's wrong, fly up, fly home.

        What I wanna do is take a little ride with you, on the wings of love,
        woh-oh one more time, one more time.


        Two Women  [?]

        I got two women, yes I've got, one need me feel, but I need you
        Been so strange, I don't know what I've done
        I think I'm freezin' in the heat of the sun.

        My woman say she love me, say what'll wanna do you
        I just don't know what to do, I know I love her,
        But another woman mine
        I just don't know what to do, can't be the one who's cryin'

        And I feel so strange about what I've done
        Yes, you know I feel like a freezin', freezin' in the heat of the sun
        I say why have I always got two rollin' the same ol' time?


        Unbroken Chain  [Lesh/Peterson] (GD2)

        Blue light rain, whoa unbroken chain,
        Looking for familiar faces in an empty window pane.

        Listening for the secret, searching for the sound
        But I could only hear the preacher and the baying of his hounds.

        Willow sky, whoa, I walk and wonder why,
        They say love your brother, but you will catch it when you try.

        Roll you down the line boy, drop you for a loss,
        Ride you out on a cold railroad and nail you to a cross.

        November and more, as I wait for the score,
        They're telling me forgiveness is the key to every door.
        A slow winder day a night like forever,
        Sink like a stone, float like a feather.

        (instrumental)
        Lilac rain, unbroken chain, Song of the sawhet owl.
        Out on the mountain, it'll drive you insane,
        Listening to the winds howl

        Unbroken chain of sorrow and pearls, Unbroken chain of shy and sea.
        Unbroken chain of the western wind, Unbroken chain of you and me.

        U.S. Blues  [Garcia/Hunter] (GDA,GD2)

        Red and white, blue suede shoes, I'm Uncle Sam, how do you do?
        Gimme five, I'm still alive, ain't no luck, I learned to duck.
        Check my pulse, it don't change.
        Stay seventy-two come shine or rain.
        Wave the flag, pop the bag, rock the boat, skin the goat.
        Wave that flag, wave it wide and high.
        Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my.

        I'm Uncle Sam, that's who I am;
        Been hidin' out in a rock and roll band.
        Shake the hand that shook the hand of P.T. Barnum and Charlie Chan.
        Shine your shoes, light your fuse.  Can you use them ol' U.S. Blues?
        I'll drink your health, share your wealth,
        Run your life, steal your wife.
        Wave that flag, wave it wide and high.
        Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my.

        Back to back chicken shack.  Son of a gun, better change your act.
        We're all confused, what's to lose?
        You can call this all the United States Blues.
        Wave that flag, wave it wide and high.
        Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my.

        Hey Valerie, Baby what's the matter with you?
        I did all of the things that you wanted me to
        I went downtown with my picket knife, cut your other man,
        Cut your other man, but I spared his life
        Valerie won't you be good to me?

        Hey Valerie, Baby what's the matter with you?
        Come on, come Baby, and tell me true
        Hey now Baby, what did I do?  I shot my dog 'cause he growled at you
        Valerie won't you be good to me?

        Valerie what's the matter with me?  I never ever done you no wrong
        I sing the blues nearly all night long.
        Valerie what the matter with me?
        You know I'd do anything that you'd say
        I can't understand why you tell me "Please go away"

        I ain't afraid of the cold. cruel world outside
        No chicken little running from a falling sky
        The only thing trouble's me is you.  If you leave me what will I do?
        Valerie won't you be good to me?

        You got me down on the knees of my shaking feet
        Can't play the blues 'cause for you I drop the beat
        Valerie what your complaint?  I try to be everything I ain't
        Valerie won't you be good to me?


        Victim or the Crime  [Weir/Barlow]

        Patience runs out on the junkie
        The dark side hires another soul
        Did he steal his fate or earn it?
        Was he force fed? Did he learn it?
        Whatever happened to his precious self control?

        Like him I'm tired of trying to heal
        This tomcat heart with which I'm blessed
        Is destruction loving's twin?
        Must I choose to lose or win?
        Maybe when my turn comes I will have guessed.

        These are the horns of the dilemma.
        What truth is proof against all lies?
        When sacred fails before profane,
        The wisest man is deemed insane.
        Even the purest of romantics compromise.

        What fixation feeds this fever,
        As the full moon pales and climbs.
        Am I living truth or rank deceiver?
        Am I the victim or the crime?
        Am I the victim or the crime?
        Am I the victim or the crime?
        Or the crime?

        And so I wrestle with the angel
        To see who'll wreath the seeds I sew.
        Am I the driver or the driven?
        Will I be damned to be forgiven?
        Is there anybody here but me who needs to know?

        What it is that feeds this fever
        As the full moon pales and climbs
        Am I living truth or rank deceiver?
        Am I the victim or the crime?
        Am I the victim or the crime?
        Am I the victim or the crime?
        Am I the victim or the crime?
        Am I the victim or the crime?
        Or the crime?


        Viola Lee Blues  [Noah Lewis]

        The judge decreed it, the clerk he wrote it.
        Clerk he wrote it down indeed-e
        Judge decreed it, clerk he wrote it down
        Give you this jail sentence you'll be Nashville bound

        Some got six month some got one solid.
        Some got one solid year indeed-e
        Some got six month some got one solid.
        But me and my buddies all got lifetime here

        I wrote a letter I mailed in the air, Mailed it on the air indeed-e
        I wrote a letter I mailed in the air.
        You may know by that I've got a friend somewhere


        Visions of Johanna  [Dylan]

        Ain't it just like the night to play tricks
        when you're tryin' to be so quiet?
        We sit here stranded, though we're all doin' our best to deny it.
        And Louise holds a handful of rain temptin' you to defy it.
        Lights flicker from the opposite left.
        In this room the heat pipes just cough.
        The country music station plays soft,
        But there's nothing, really nothing, to turn off.
        Just Louise and her lovers so entwined
        And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.

        In the empty lot where the ladies play
        blindman's bluff with a key chain,
        And all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the "D" train.
        We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight,
        ask himself if it's him or them that's really insane.
        But Louise she's alright, she's just near,
        She's delicate and she seems like the mirror,
        But she just makes it all too concise and too clear,
        That Johanna's not here.
        The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face.
        Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.

        Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously.
        He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
        And when bringing her name up he speaks of her farewell kiss to me.

        He's sure got alot of gall, to be so useless and all,
        Muttering small talk at the wall, while I'm in the hall.
        Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
        And these visions of Johanna they kept me up past the dawn.

        Inside the museums Infinity goes up on trial
        Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while.
        But even Mona Lisa must have had the highway blues,
        you can tell by the way she smiles
        See the primative wallflower freeze.
        When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
        Hear the one with the mustache say "Jeeze, I can't find my knees."
        Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
        But the visions of Johanna they make it all seem so cruel.

        The peddlar now speaks to the countess
        Who's pretending to care for him.
        Saying "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out
        and say a prayer for him."
        But like Louise always says "Ya can't look at much can ya man?"
        As she, herself prepares for him
        And Madonna she still has not showed,
        We see this empty cage now corrode,
        Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
        The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
        He writes ev'rything's been returned which was owed
        On the back of the fish truck that loads,
        While my conscience explodes.
        The harmonicas play the skeleton key and the rain
        And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.


        Wake Up Little Susie  [Felice & Boudleaux Bryant]

        Wake up little Susie, wake up.  Wake up little Susie, wake up.
        The movie wasn't so hot, it didn't have much of a plot
        We fell asleep, out goose is cooked, our reputation is shot
        Wake up little Susie, wake up little Susie

        What are you gonna tell your mama, what you gonna tell your pa
        What are you gonna tell your friend when they say ooo la la
        Wake up little Susie, wake up little Susie

        Well I told your mama that you'd be back by ten
        Now Susie, baby looks like we goofed again
        Wake up little Susie, wake up little Susie, we gotta go home

        Wake up little Susie, wake up.  Wake up little Susie, wake up.
        We both fell sound asleep, wake up little Susie and weep
        Yeah, the movie's over
        It's four o'clock and we're in trouble deep
        Wake up little Susie, wake up little Susie

        Even in the morning if I have to, rob the blind.
        I've been mistreated and I don't mind dying, I wanna leave.
        Even if I have to rob the blind.
        I've been mistreated and I don't mind dying.

        Some people tell ya that walking, blues ain't bad.
        'Cause it's the worst old feeling I most ever had,
        Don't let them tell you, walking blues ain't so bad.
        Worst old feeling I most ever had.

        Walking the Dog  [Rufus Thomas]

        Baby's back all dressed in black.  Silver buttons all down her back
        High ho tip the toes, she broke the needle now she can't sew

        Walking the dog, I'm just a walking the dog
        If you don't know how to do it, I'll show you how to walk that dog

        Mary, Mary, quite contrary, how does your garden grow
        With silver bells and cockle shells and pretty maids all in a row

        I asked my mother for fifteen cents, I see her ever I jump the fence
        I jumped the sky I touched the sky,
        Never come down 'till the fourth of July


        Walk in the Sun  [?]

        Oh I know there is no place you can go to
        And I know you don't know anyone at all
        So come walking in the sun with me my little one
        And remember that the only time is now

        Oh how strange is the story your eyes tell me
        And quiet all the new words that you say
        So come and hold my hand for you see I'd understand
        And remember the only time is now

        Oh I come to you ragged up stranger
        And you come to me an angel of the nite
        So all dancing, we will sing, for it doesn't mean a thing
        And remember that the only time is now

        So forget about your yesterdays of sorrow
        And forget about the darkness you have seen
        For there's only you and me at the edge of an endless sea
        And remember that the only time is now


        Walk in the Sunshine  [Weir/Barlow]

        Look out cause here comes some free advice.

        Walk in the sunshine, watch for the bright sun,
        Be all those things you're able to be.

        You got to listen to the heavens, you got to try to understand,
        The grateness of their movement is just as small as it is grand.

        Try not to hurry, it's just not your worry.
        Leave it to those all caught up in time.

        You got to deep-six your wristwatch, you got to try and understand,
        The time it seems to capture is just the movement of its hands.

        I ain't preachin', 'cause I don't know
        How to make fast things move along slow
        I can't stop it, can't make it go.

        Just 'cause I say it, that don't mean that it's so, no, no,
        Watch what you hear now, make sure it's clear now,
        Just 'cause it's said that don't mean that it's true.  So all we say:

        You got to make a revolution, you got to help me with my cause.
        You got to burn down all the buildings,
        You got to throw out all the laws.

        I ain't burning, Lord, I'm still only learning
        How to become a man of my own.

        I ain't crazy, nor am I lazy,
        Just want to find out what's right and what's wrong.

        I ain't crazy, all the world keeps on turning,
        I'm still trying to find out what's right and what's wrong.

        I ain't crazy!

        Wave That Flag  [Garcia/Hunter]

        Wave that flag, pop the bag, skin the goat, learn to cope
        Bell the rat, trap the cat, ball the jack, chew the fat
        Read the signs, connect the lines, pay your fines, save your dimes
        Pick up time, light the fuse, making time, pass the juice

        Eat at days, hide in caves, pull the tooth, stretch the truth
        Feed the poor, starve the war, pick up chicks, catch the fix
        Get your kicks, pick up sticks, trim your wick, take your pick
        Try your tricks, impress the chicks

        Wash the fence, dig the den, live the vain, die in shame
        Catch the fool, burn the stew, shine your shoes, sing the blues

        Wave the flag, pop the bag, bell the cat, trap the rat
        Ball the jack, chew the fat, shoot the breeze, lose the keys
        Read the signs, connect the lines, pay your fines, read the rhyme
        Shhot the breeze, lose your keys, don't be late, what I say

        Walk on waves, read the raves, eat at day, hide in caves
        Stretch the truth, pull the tooth, feed the poor, starve the war
        Cash the fix, get your kicks, trim your wick, take your pick
        Try your tricks, impress the chicks

        Wash the fence, dig the den, live the shame,die in vain
        Catch the fool, burn the stew, shine your shoes, sing the blues


        Wave to the Wind   [Robert Hunter, Phil Lesh]
 
        Gonna wave to the people
        looking on the side of
        the road as I'm rolling by
        Wave goodbye to trouble
        that's always on my mind
        Gonna jumpstart my life
        or go down trying
        Gonna wave to the mem'ries
        I carry in my heart and the
        new ones I'll find along my way;
        to the new millenium
        reeling 'round the bend like
        a dove or a dark-wing bird of prey
 
        Gonna wave, gonna wave
        Gonna wave to the wind
        Gonna wave my way
        my way on through the wind
        Gonna wave, Gonna wave
        Gonna wave to the wind
        Gonna wave my way to the
        edge of the world and jump in
 
        Gonna snap like a banner
        sailing sheets to the breeze over
        oceans of sky to the moon
        I could hold out forever
        keeping it together
        or wish upon a star and call the tune
        Lift my voice like the young man
        broken in the war who
        cries out to know the reason why
        Gonna rise up and reel out
        the love song in my soul to the
        high wide and handsome morning sky
 
        Gonna wave, gonna wave
        Gonna wave to the wind
        Gonna wave my way
        my way on through the wind
        Gonna wave, Gonna wave
        Gonna wave while the wind
        plays the stars, the sky, the
        moon and the night like a hymn
 
        Gonna ride with the thunder
        let the sky crack asunder
        as lightning cries out the rain
        Gonna wade across rivers
        gathered in the streams from the
        mountains that rise above the plain
        Wave away my confusion
        that drives this delusion
        so long I forgot that I could fly
        Soar aloft like a songbird
        dancing in the wind,
        singing long, singing loud, singing high
 
        Gonna speak to the breeze,
        add my voice to the wind
        singing: say, can you see me
        by the dawn's early light screaming in?


         Way To Go Home  [Vince Welnick, Robert Hunter, Brad Bralove]


         Who do you think you are?
         what do you mean when you put us all down
         walking round in circles
         your nose to the ground
         you think you're saying something 
         because you're making a sound
         you say you've seen it all
         you don't care to see no more
         but you don't get up and go
         until they throw you out the door

         it's a long long long long way to go home
         it's a long long long long way to go home
         any which way you are tempted to roam
         it's a long long long long long long way 
         way to go home

         who do remind me of
         what do you do when you do your own time
         did you run away from the scene of your crime
         i feel as though i know you
         could you spare me a dime
         its a lot less than a prison
         but it's more than a jail
         i'd tell you all about it
         but that's another tale

         it's a long long long long way to go home
         it's a long long long long way to go home
         any which way you are tempted to roam
         it's a long long long long long long long long way 
         way to go home

         (bridge)
         you say you've seen it all
         you don't care to see no more
         the hungry and the hopeless
         the crippled and the poor
         you say you've seen enough 
         to last you all your days
         but like the moon in heaven 
         your just going through a phase

         who do you want to be?
         what do you need
         to set your body free
         i don't mean to pry
         This aint the third degree
         but looking at you baby
         you remind myself of me
         if there's anyway to tell you
         anyway to persuade
         I'd really love to spare you
         The mistakes I've made

         it's a long long long long way to go home
         it's a long long long long way to go home
         any which way you are tempted to roam
         it's a long long long long long long long long way 
         way to go home


        The Way You Do the Things You Do   [?]

        You got a smile so bright,
        You know you could've been a candle.
        I'm holdin' you so tight,
        You know you could've been a handle.
        The way you swept me off my feet,
        You know you could've been a broom.
        The way you smell so sweet,
        You know you could've been some perfume.

        Well, you could've been anything that you wanted to;
        And I can tell
        The way you do the things you do.

        As pretty as you are,
        You know you could've been a flower.
        If good looks was a minute,
        You know that you could be an hour.
        The way you stole my heart,
        You know you could've been a cool crook.
        And, baby, you're so smart,
        You know you could've been a school book.

        Well, you could've been anything that you wanted to;
        And I can tell
        The way you do the things you do.

        - break & key change -

        You made my life so rich,
        You know you could've been some money.
        Baby, youre so sweet,
        You know you could've been some honey.

        Well, you could've been anything that you wanted to;
        And I can tell
        The way you do the things you do.
        The way you do the things you do.
        The way you do the things you do.



        We Can Run  [Mydland/Barlow]

        We don't own this place, though we act as if we did.
        It belongs to the children of our children's kids.
        The actual owners haven't even been born yet.

        But we never tend the garden and rarely we pay the rent,
        Some of it is broken and the rest of it is bent
        Put it all on plastic and I wonder where we'll be when the bills hit.

        Chorus:
        We can run, but we can't hide from it.
        Of all possible worlds, we only got one
        We gotta ride on it.
        Whatever we've done, we'll never get far from what we leave behind,
        Baby, we can run, run, run, but we can't hide,
        Oh no, we can't hide.

        I'm dumpin' my trash in your back yard
        Bein' sure you don't notice really isn't so hard
        You're so busy making guns you barely have time to use them.

        Well, it's oil for the rich and babies for the poor,
        We got everyone believing that more is more,
        If a reckoning comes, maybe we'll know what to do then.

        Bridge:
        All these complications seem to leave no choice,
        I heard the tongues of billions speak with just one voice,
        Saying, "Just leave all the rest to me,
        I need it worse than you, you see."
        And then I heard the sound of one child crying.

        Today I went walking in the amber wind,
        There's a hole in sky where the light pours in
        I remembered the days when I wasn't afraid of the sunshine.

        But now it beats down on the asphalt land
        Like a hammering blow from God's left hand
        What little still grows cringes in the shade like a bad vine.


        Weather Report Suite Part I  [Weir/Eric Anderson] (GD2)

               E                    C#m            D
        Winter rain, now tell me why   summers fade and roses die.
                   C#m7                    F#m  A E  A E
        The answer came, the wind and rain.
               E                       C#m             D
        Golden hills now veiled in gray,  summer leaves have blown away.
                   C#m7                     F#m  A E  A E
        Now what remains, the wind and rain.

      E7                  C#     A                         G
        And like a desert spring, my lover comes and spreads her wings.
        D               G
        Knowing, like a song that's born to soar the sky;
        D                 G
        Flowing, flowing 'til the waters all are dry;
        D            C                  E A
        Growing, the lovin' in her eyes.

        Circle songs and sands of time,
        And seasons will end in tumbled rhyme,
        And little change, the wind and rain.

        And like a desert spring, my lover comes and spreads her wings,
        Knowing, like a song that's born to soar the sky;
        Flowing, flowing 'til the rivers all are dry;
        Growing, the lovin' in her eyes.

        [Bridge]
       B                    E        B                      E
        Winter grey and falling rain, we'll see summer come again;
       B                      E
        Darkness falls and seasons change (gonna happen every time),
       B                              E
        Same old friends the wind and rain (we'll see summer by-and-by),
       B                    E
        Winter gray and falling rain (summers fade and roses die),
       B                       E
        We'll see summer come again (like a song that's born to soar the sky)

        [Intro: A C#m F#m E D] 2x

       A              C#m             D                       A
        I pulled into Nazareth, I was feeling about half past dead.
       A              C#m              D            A
        I just needed someplace, where I can lay my head.

        Take a load off, Fannie. And (And (And))---
        You put the load right on me
                        (You put the load right on me)  [A C#m F#m E D] 2x

        I picked up my bags, I went lookin' for a place to hide.
        When I saw Carmen & the Devil, walkin' side-by-side.
        I said, "Hey, Carmen, c'mon let's go downtown."
        She said, "I gotta go, but my friend can stick around."

        [Chorus]

        Lay down Miss Moses, there's nothing you can say.
        It's just old Luke, & Luke's waiting on the judgement day.
        "Well Luke my friend, what about young Annalee?"
        He said, "Do me a favor, son, won't you stay & keep Annalee company?"

        [Chorus]

        Crazy Chester come to me, just a looking for the door.
        He said, "I'll fix ya right, if you take Jack my dog."
        I said, "Wait a minute Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man."
        He said, "Okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can?"

        [Chorus]

        Lord getcha cannonball, now to take me down the line.
        My bag is sinkin' low, and I do believe it's time
        To get back to Miss Fannie, you know she's the only one
        Who sent me here with her, regards for everyone.

        Werewolves of London  [Warren Zevon]

        I saw a werewolf with a Chinese menu in his hand
        Walking thru the streets of Soho in the rain
        He was looking for the place called Lee Ho Fook's
        Going to get himself a big dish of beef chow mein
        Ah-oo, the werewolves of London

        If you hear his howling around the kitchen door
        You better not let him in
        Little old lady got mutilated last nite
        Werewolves of London again
        Ah-oo, werewolves of London

        He's the hairy-handed gent who ran amuck in Kent
        Lately he's been overheard in Mayfair
        You better stay away from him, he'll rip your lungs out Jim
        I'd like to meet his tailor
        Ah-oo, werewolves of London

        Well, I saw Lon Cheney walking with the Queen
        Doing the werewolves of London
        I saw Lon Cheney Jr. walking with the Queen
        I saw a werewolf drinking a pina colada at Trader Vic's
        And his hair was perfect
        Ah-oo, the werewolves of London, draw blood

        I'm looking for a chateau, 21 rooms but one will do
        I don't want to buy it
        I just want to rent it for a minute or two

        I met an old mistake walking down the street today
        I met an old mistake walking down the street today
        I didn't want to be mean about it
        I couldn't think of one good thing to say.

        West L.A. fadeaway, West L.A. fadeaway
        Big red lite on the highway, little green lite on the freeway.

        Got a steady job moving items for the mob

        It's a shame those boys couldn't be more copasetic

        Big red lite on the highway, little green lite on the freeway.

        I need a West L.A. girl, already know what I need to know
        I need a West L.A. girl, already know what I need to know
        A name, address and a phone number,
        Lord, just how far to go.

        West L.A. fadeaway, here's one chance you say.
        She tries to live by the Golden Rule.
        Said you treat other people right,
        Other people probably treat you cool.

        More than my wine, more than my maker, though he's no friend of mine.

        Everyone said, I'd come to no good,
        I knew I would Pearly, believe them.

        Waves of violet go crashing and laughing
        The rainbow winged singing birds fly 'round the sun
        Sun bells rain down in a liquid profusion
        Mermaids on porpoises draw up the dawn
        What's become of the baby this cold December morning?

        Songbirds frozen in their flight
        Drifting to the earth, remnants of forgotten dreaming
        Dawning answer comes there none.

        Go to sleep you child, dream of never-ending always
        Panes of crystal ice sparkle like waterfalls
        Lighting the polished ice caverns of the dawn,
        But where in the looking-glass fields of illusion
        Wandered the child who was perfect as the dawn?
        What's become of the baby this cold December morning?
        What's become of the baby this cold December morning?

        Racing in rhythm of the sun
        All the world revolves captured in the eye of woman
        Allah, where are you now?

        All eyes are blinded by the sparkling waters
        Scheherazade gethering stories to tell
        From primal gold fantasy petals that fold,
        But where is the child who played with the sunshines?
        And chased the cloud shape to the regions of mind?
        Standing stream cries the south wind
        Lost in the regions of
        Shadow-like chains of illusion, delusions of living and dead.


        What Will You Raise  [?]

        I know the lady face to face
        Who rules the joker and commands the race
        I just rolled in from the golden state
        A dusty spoke on the wheel of fate
        What will you raise to take my hand?

        [Chorus]
            G                                      C

            G                               C
        You can't let go and you can't hold on,

        F                    Bb         C
        Won't you try just a little bit harder,
        F                       Bb         C     |C . . .|4 times
        Couldn't you try just a little bit more?

        G                       C      G                        D
        Round, round robin run around, got to get back to where you belong.
          G
        A little bit harder, just a little bit more,
          D                           G
        A little bit further than you gone before.

        [Chorus]
        |F . Bb F|Bb F Bb C|  |C . . .|4 times
        |F . Bb F|Bb F Bb C|

        C                                F
        Small wheel turn by the fire and rod,
        C                              F
        Big wheel turn by the grace of God,
        C                           F
        Every time that wheel turn 'round,
        C
        Bound to cover just a little more ground.
        [tacet]
        Bound to cover just a little more ground.

        [Chorus]

        Won't you try just a little bit harder,
        Couldn't you try just a little bit more?
        Won't you try just a little bit harder,
        Couldn't you try just a little bit more?

        [Jam on half a verse chords]

        Oh, the hours I've spent inside the Coliseum,
        Dodging lions and wastin' time.
        Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle,
        I can hardly stand to see 'em,
        Yes, it sure has been a long hard climb.

        Train wheels runnin' thru the back of my memory,
        When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese.
        Someday, everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody,
        When I paint my masterpiece.

        When Push Comes to Shove  [Garcia/Hunter]

        Shaking in the forest, what have you to fear?
        Here there may be tigers, to punch you in the ear.
        With gloves of stainless steel, bats carved out of bricks
        Knock you down and beat you up and give your ass a kick.
        When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love.

        Shaking in the desert, now wherefore do you cry?
        Here there may be rattlesnakes, to punch you in the eye.
        With Shotgun's full of silver and bullet's made of glass
        String barbed wire at your feet, that will not let you pass.
        When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love.

        When push comes to shove, when push comes to shove,
        You're afraid of love, when push comes to shove.

        Shaking in the bedroom, covers on your head,
        Are you still in fear of the hand beneath the bed?
        Grabbing at the handle, scratching at the door,
        Maybe it's mystery killer you saw on channel four.
        When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love.

        Shaking in the garden, the fear within you grows,
        Here there may be roses, to punch you in the nose.
        Put my arms around you, love you til you cry,
        Wrap you in your sweet perfume and squeeze you 'til you die.
        When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love.

        When push comes to shove, when push comes to shove,
        You're afraid of love, when push comes to shove.


        Who Do You Love  [Bo Diddley]

        I walked 47 miles of barbed wire
        I got a cobra snake for a necktie
        Got a house down by the roadside made out of rattlesnake hide
        Come on child take a walk with me and tell me who do you love


        Why Don't We Do It In The Road  [McCartney]

        Why don't we do it in the road?
        Why don't we do it in the road?
        Why don't we do it in the road?
        No one will be watchin' us, why don't we do it in the road?


        Wild Horses  [Jagger/Richard]

     C#m          A     C#m           A
        Childhood living,  is easy to do.
      Bm                    D      A                  E
        The things that you wanted, I bought them for you.
     C#m          A   C#m               A
        Graceless lady,  you know who I am.
      Bm                 D       A                 E
        You know I can't let you, slide through my hands.

        [Chorus]
      Bm     D      A         G        D
        Wild horses, couldn't drag me away.
      Bm           D      A      G             D
        Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them someday.

        I watched you suffer, a dull aching pain.
        But now you've decided, to show me the same.
?       No sweeping axes, of stage light.
        Could make me feel bitter, or treat you unkind.

        [Chorus]
        [Jam on verse and chorus chords]

        I know I've dreamed you, a sin and a lie.
        Now I have my freedom, but I don't have much time.
        Faith has been broken, tears must be cried.
        Let's do some living, after we die.

        [Chorus]
        Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them someday.

        Women Are Smarter  [N.Span]

        [Intro/Song: D A D]

        Let us put men and women together, to see which one is smarter,
        Some say men, but I say no,
        The women got the men like a puppet show.

        It ain't me it's the people that say,
        Men are leading women astray,
        I say, it's the women today,
        Smarter than the men in every way,

        That's right the women are smarter,
        That's right the women are smarter,
        That's right the women are smarter
        The women are smarter that's right.

        Little boy sit in the corner and cry,
        Big man come and ask him why,
        He said "I can't do what the big boys do",
        The man sat down and he cried too.

        It ain't me it's the people that say,
        Men are leading women astray,
        I say, it's the women today,
        Smarter than the men in every way.

        That's right the women are smarter,
        That's right the women are smarter,
        That's right the women are smarter
        The women are smarter that's right.

        Ever since the world began women been bending
        The ways of men,
        But listen boys, cause I've got a plan,
        Give it up, don't try to understand.

        It ain't me it's the people that say,
        Men are leading women astray,
        I say, it's the women today,
        Smarter than the men in every way.

        That's right the women are smarter,
        That's right the women are smarter,
        That's right the women are smarter
        The women are smarter that's right.


        Yellow Moon  [Hunter]

        Anxious hope and thoughts of love will never let me down,
        Not let me go
        Inside, my heart's a cage of ice Loved and lost,
        Still toss the lonely dice
        I burned the whole night long my thoughts were never far from you
        Love that locks and binds must die
        But when it dies a part of you dies too.

        Born, born, born upon the world the restless heart keeps flying,
        Trying to become the heart of home.
        Love, love, love, it picks you up and spins you round,
        Sits you right back down where you belong.

        I don't fit my hat sometimes, I get so full of clouds
        Every time I pass your door I hear you cry out loud
        Sometimes I look the same to you as you have looked to me
        My eyes get filled so full of stars, I don't know when I leave

        Born, born, born upon the world the restless heart keeps flying,
        Trying to become the heart of home.
        Love, love, love, it picks you up and spins you round,
        Sits you right back down where you belong.

        Love is like tha April rain that makes the harvest grow
        And when it grows it's like the summer gold
        Love is like the coloured leaves that drift down from the trees
        One by one 'til every tale is told

        Now if I go a dancing out across the yellow moon
        I'll be home by morning if it doesn't come too soon
        If you seek protection go and find a safer man
        And if he can't give you what you want then come on by again.

        Priestess of the sun and moon and goddess of the wind
        You know too much to ever lose and not enough to win
        Though you built your house upon the rock and not upon the sand
        You're still looking out your window for another travelin' man.

        Born, born, born upon the world the restless heart keeps flying,
        Trying to become the heart of home.
        Love, love, love, it picks you up and spins you round,
        Sits you right back down where you belong.

        You Ain't Woman Enough To Take My Man  [Loretta Lynn]

        You come to tell me something, you say I ought to know
        That he don't love me anymore and I have to let him go
        Oh, you say you're gonna take him, but I don't think you can
        'Cause you ain't woman enough to take my man

        Oh, women like you they come a dime a dozen,
        You can buy 'em anywhere
        For you to get him I'll have to move over
        And I'm gonna stay right here
        Well it'll be over my dead body, you better get out while you can

        If you wanna know what time it is, you don't have to ask
        If you wanna know what something is, you don't have to ask
        If you wanna know whats real or not, you don't have to ask
        If you wanna know what time is now, you don't have to ask
        You don't have to ask, you already know

        If you wanna leave just close your eyes, you don't have to ask
        If you wanna go and lose your mind, you don't have to ask
        If it's peace that you're looking for
        You got the key to every door, you already know

        If there's a way out you'll find out and free all and be all beyond
        You never wonder what sky you been under
        That made you forget all this time

        If you're looking for it, you don't have to ask
        You can see it plain as day, you don't have to ask
        If you try to find us true, just take a look at you,
        You don't have to ask


        Youngblood  [?]

        I saw her standing on the corner, yellow ribbon in her hair
        I knew at once I was a goner, said lookie there, lookie there
        Youngblood, youngblood, youngblood, I can't get you out of my mind

        I tried to talk, my tongue was fractured
        I tried to walk, but I was lame
        Could'nt stop myseld from shouting
        What's your name, what's your name?

        Crazy stuff, sure look tough, had to follow her all the way home
        Things went bad, I met her dad
        He said "You better leave my daughter alone"

        I could'nt sleep that night for trying, I saw the rising of the sun
        All night long my heart felt like crying
        You're the one, You're the one


        You Win Again  [Hank Williams]

        The news is out, all over town that you've been seen,
        Out runnin' 'round.
        I know that I should leave her there,
        But then I just can't go, you win again.
        This heart of mine, could never see what everybody knows but me.
        Just trustin' you was my great sin, I just can't go, Lord
        You win again.  What can I do, Lord, You win again.</pre>
