HOOKS

capo 3rd fret

E                      Am     D9
drifting like a paper plane
blown off course, without a name
find yourself and lose your mind
too tired to fight, too proud to whine

chorus:
C
she's reluctant to agree
Em                    Am
she left her hooks in me
                B7
I wish I could believe

Fate will claim the upper hand
only the vanquished understand
winning is so uninspired
I can dream of lakes of fire

>

punctured by a thorny rose
zombie strikes a khaki pose
trodden by the march of time
drowning in a drop of wine

>

chasing shadows through the dark
with deeper focus than a shark
neglected callous overgrown
the humble rogue still sleeps alone
