Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl but she doesn't have a lot to say
D                                        E7                   A
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl but she changes from day to day

I wanna tell her that I love her a lot but I gotta get a belly fulla wine
Gm              D           B7        Em7           A        D      
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl some day I'm gonna make her mine
   B7         Em7           A7       D
oh yeah, some day I'm gonna make her mine
