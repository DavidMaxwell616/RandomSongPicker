            I saw my transcription of Criminal by Fiona Apple on OLGA (it was my
            first submission, so I was excited to see it) and realized I left a
            chord out. Here's the updated version. People at OLGA: please 
replace
            my last submission with this one. Thanks.

            Song: Criminal
            Artist: Fiona Apple
            Transcription by Jake Schneider

            Since this song has no recognizable guitar stuff, I decided to make 
            my
            own arrangement for guitar. Send comments/suggestions to:
            jakester@centuryinter.net
            There may be one discrepancy (I'm aware of it) in re: to the Cm
            pentatonic bass groove being played and the guitar playing a C7 over 
            top
            of it. I tried playing a Cm/Cm7 chord but the C7 sounded better to 
            me.

            CRIMINAL FIONA APPLE

            [C minor pentatonic bass groove] x 8 Guitar: C7

            I've been a bad bad girl 
            I've been careless with a delicate man
            And it's a sad sad world
            When a girl will break a boy
            Just because she can

            Don't you tell me to deny it
            I've done wrong and I want to
            Suffer for my sins
            I've come to you ^Ñcause I need
            Guidance to be true
            And I just don't know where I can begin

            What I need is a good defense
            ^Ñcause I'm feelin' like a criminal
            And I need to be redeemed
            To the one I've sinned against
            Because he's all I ever knew of love 

            Heaven help me for the way I am 
            save me from these evil deeds
            Before I get them done
            I know tomorrow brings the consequence at hand
            But I keep livin' this day like the next one will never come

            Oh help me but don't tell me to deny it
            I've got to cleanse myself of all these lies ^Ñtil I'm good enough 
            for
            him 
            I've got a lot to lose and I'm bettin' high
            So I'm beggin' you before it ends
            Just tell me where to begin

            chorus x1 

            [C minor pentatonic bass groove] x 4 Guitar: C7

            Let me know the way before there's hell to pay
            Give me room to lay the law and let me go
            I've got to make a play to make my lover stay
            So what would an angel say
            The devil wants to know

            chorus x2
            *************************************************************************

            [C7 Bb7 F7] x1
            [C7 Bb7 Am] x1
            [C7 Bb7 Ab7 G7 F7 Ab7]

            Chorus: [F7 C7] x2
            [F7 C7 Bb7 Ab7 G7 F7]

            Bridge: [D#7 B7 Ab7 B7 D#7 B7 Ab7] x2

            *************************************************************************
            footnote: I tried this version out with my band (we're a 3-piece: 
            drums,
            bass, & guitar-with a chick singer) and it worked out well! I think 
            if
            a band did this number "Unplugged" it would come across very 'cool' 
            to
            the audience.
