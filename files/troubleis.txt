E
Well it’s warm inside
Let’s take a midnight drive
I wanna show ya...yeah really show ya
        A
It’s an open road
Let’s see how far it goes
          E
I wanna show ya...yeah really show ya
       B
We’re high flyin’ low
 A
Don’t you wanna go
       G F E
On a slow ride

Well it’s cold outside
But there’s fire in your eyes
I wanna hold you...baby let me hold you
I won’t lose my nerve
On those dangerous curves
When we get rollin’...oh really rollin’

I say high flyin’ low
Don’t you wanna go
On a slow ride
Slow ride

Solo

Yeah slide on in, don’t stop...?
Let’s get movin’...oh really movin’
Won’t you hold on time we can make it all night
Let’s get movin’...oh really movin’

I say high flyin’ low
Don’t you wanna go
On a slow ride
Slow ride
Slow ride

{intro}
D     C     G    D     C     G

{verse 1}
D     C   G  			D	C    G	
Night falls, and I'm all alone
D     C    G  		D	C    G	
Skin, chilled to the bone
D    C   G  	   D 	C    G	
You, turned and you ran
D        C   G  		D	C    G	
Slipped, right from my hand


{chorus}
D
Blue on Black, Tears on a river
C
Push on a shove 
    G
It don't mean much
D
Joker on Jack, Match on fire
C
Cold on ice
    G
A dead man's touch
D
Whisper on a scream
C				G
Doesn't change (mean) a thing
				Am	G (tacet)
Won't (don't) bring you back
Blue on Black

{intro}

{verse 2}
Blind, now I see
Truth, lies and in between
Wrong, can't be undone
Slipped, from the tip of your tongue

{chorus 4 x}
