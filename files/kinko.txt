"Kinko, Kinko, the kid loving clown, 
if the kids just love me back, 
I'll never wear a frown. 

Kinko's in his kinko car, 
pockets full of change, 
lots of dirty pictures and sticky candycanes. 

All the kids love Kinko for the presents that they get, 
silly leather clothes to wear and happy cigarettes. 

Hi boys and girls!! 
My name is Kinko the Clown and I really love you boys and girls.. really... really... hehe 

We go to Kinko's club house sometimes after school, 
we play in Kinko's crawl space, 
there's never any rules. 

We have to sit on Kinko's lap, 
there's never any chairs, 
Kinko likes to tickle us and give us funny stares! 

'Mommy! Mommy! Kinko hurt me!' 

Aw, but that was in Indianapolis and thanks to the liberal reciprocity laws, 
Kinko can be with you boys and girls today or anytime... 

Jimmy Johnson ran away and didn't say goodbye, 
Kinko went to look for him and help the FBI.

But Kinko had some handcuffs on, 
his eyes were full of tears, 
said, 'I'll be back to play with you, 
sometime in twenty years...' awwwwww!! 

Kinko, Kinko the kid loving clown, 
your parents want to beat me up and run me out of town. 

Kinko, Kinko the kid loving clown, 
tar and feather Kinko and run him out of town!
