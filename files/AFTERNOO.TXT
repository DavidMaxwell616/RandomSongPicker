I love this song... I had to figure it out when I saw this request.  
I was told that this should be tuned down a whole tone.

      G                 
Gonna find my baby, gonna hold her tight, 
                     Am7
gonna grab some afternoon delight. 
   G                              Am7                                                                  
My motto's always been when it's right, it's right,  
                                D7         Am7
Why wait until the middle of a cold, dark night 

when everythings a little clearer in the light of day 
                D7  
and we know the night is always gonna be here anyway?
    G                                                                                                               
Thinking of you is working up my appetite 
                                 Am7
looking forward to a little afternoon delight.
                           G
Rubbing sticks and stones together make the sparks ignite and
     Am7
the thought of rubbing you is getting so exciting.

Chorus

 G                          D         B7	            
Sky rockets in flight, afternoon    delight                            
Em      	  Am7 Bm7 C          D7
af---------------ternoon
  G        Am7     Bm    C            D7     G
delight, af-----------------------ternoon      delight

second verse - (repeat chords)

Started out this morning feeling so polite, 
thought a fish could not be caught who didn't bite.  
But you got some bait awaiting and I think I might like
nibbling a little afternoon delight.

Chorus

Am7                                  D7   
Be waiting for me baby when I come around.  
               Am7                     D7
We can make a lot of loving before the sun gone down
     D7      Am    Bm   C           G
af------------------------afternoon delight
