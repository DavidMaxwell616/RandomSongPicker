Ain't she sweet-Jack Yellen and Milton Ager
E      C   B7             E      C        B7     
Ain't she sweet? See her coming down the street
       E       G#    C7            F#    B7   E
Now I ask you very confidentially ain't she sweet

E      C   B7             E      C        B7     
Ain't she nice look her over once or twice
       E       G#    C7            F#    B7   E
now I ask you very confidentially ain't she nice?

             A  Am            E      E7
Just cast an eye    in her direction 
          A  Am                   E        B7      
oh me oh my!       Ain't that perfection?

E      C   B7             E      C        B7     
I repeat don't you think that's kind of neat?
       E       G#    C7            F#    B7   E
And I ask you very confidentially ain't she sweet?
