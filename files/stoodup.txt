STOOD UP

E                  F#sus7       A5 
and the lights are turned down low
and the wind is beginning to blow
I been waiting here oh so long
I'm beginning to think something's wrong

My patience is wearing thin
cause you're so late once again
the food I cooked is cold on its plate 
as you construct a reason for being late

   Fmaj7           Cmaj7 
But when I see your face
Fmaj7                      Cmaj7
Like a fallen angel feigning grace 
   Fmaj7                    Cmaj7 
You seem sincere although I know your way
Fmaj7                          Cmaj7
and you know just how and just what to say 
Dm
I begin to soften inside
B7
Set my doubts aside 
           E   
and let it slide

The fireplace is now just ash
the cat asleep, I raided my last stash 
snow is whispering outside
impatience impeding my high

the wine bottle empty and alone
in silence lies the telephone
now I hear you car outside
I pull out another bottle and let this one slide
