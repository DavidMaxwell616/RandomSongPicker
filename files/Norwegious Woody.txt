Norwegian model
on my laptop
dancing a bugaloo
a bug or two
in trousers tied with twine of tin
woven, wove in Iceland,
where tiny Bjorkish elves 
do their rumplestilksin weavin'
the Norwegian
blonde of stencils long unstenciled
yet grown grimed with carbon
not of pencils
but of time, time, time
beckons from her split screen skirt
of digital monitor myopic mayhem
Lures you
with her steel skin want,
Still skin so white as hers
so like ice gone mad with flesh
hurts, throw it off the precipice
predjudiced
against her Nordic perfection
you diserect your own erection
less erector
the set packed up before some parental
dinner
that will never come,
never come,
just a laptop
filled with porn
spam
and 
green eyes
in sheets of filo
faxed
over the rainbow.
