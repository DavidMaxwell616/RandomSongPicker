i just found me a bottle of blues
some strange comfort for a soul to soothe
ain't it hard ain't it hard,
to want somebody who doesn't want you 

and i've been waiting for a year, a day
some strange weather must be blowin' my way
cause i got no mind to go or to stay,
or be left behind 

F                               E
holdin' hands with an impotent dream
F                      E
in a brothel of fake energy
F                               G# 
put a nickel in the graveyard machine
      D9           G#  
i get higher and lower
      D9           G#  
i get higher and lower
       D9                 D#          D9 
like a tired soldier with nothin' to shoot
     F          D9                  C
and nowhere to lose this bottle of blues 

egos drone and pose alone
like black balloons all banged and blown
on a backwoods river the infidels shiver
in the stench of belief
i tell my momma i'm a hundred years late
i'm over the rails and out of the race
and the crippled psalms of an age that won't thaw
are ringing in my ears 

holdin' hands with an impotent dream
in a brothel of fake energy
put a nickel in the graveyard machine
i get higher and lower
i get higher and lower
like a tired soldier
with nothin' to shoot
and nowhere dreams it's a..
bottle of blues 

(repeat first verse)

holdin' hands with an impotent dream
in a brothel of fake energy
put a nickel in the graveyard machine
i get higher and lower
i get higher and lower
like a tired soldier
with nothin' to shoot
and nowhere dreams it's a..
