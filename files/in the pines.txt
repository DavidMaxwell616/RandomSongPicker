Where Did You Sleep Last Night(In The Pines)

   E        E7             A     G           B                        E 
My girl my girl don't you lie to me tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

My girl my girl where will you go I'm going where the cold wind blows

Her husband was a working man killed a mile and a half from here
His head was found in a driver wheel but his body never was found



[D] The longest [D7] train I [G] ever [D] saw
Went down that [A7] Georgia [D] line
The engine [D7] passed at [G] six o'[D] clock
And the cab passed [A7] by at [D] nine.

Refrain:
[D] In the pines, in the [D7] pines
Where the [G] sun never [D] shines
And we shiver when the [A7] cold wind [D] blows;
[D] Whooee-whoo-[D7] hoo; [G] whoo-hoo-[D] hoo
Whoee-whoo-[A7] whoo hoo-[D] hoo!

I asked my captain for the time of day
He said he throwed his watch away
A long steel rail and a short cross tie
I'm on my way back home.

Refrain:

Little girl, little girl, what have I done
That makes you treat me so?
You caused me to weep, you caused me to mourn
You caused me to leave my home.
