He's a mighty good leader, 
He's a mighty good leader 
He's a mighty good leader, all the way 
All the way, he's a mighty good leader 
He's a mighty good leader, all the way 

He took my mother, 
He took my mother, 
He took my mother, all the way 
All the way, way up to heaven 
He took my mother, all the way

2. SLEEPING BAG
open up the door
lay the orange juice on the floor
we're having a picnic on the ugly part of town 

the sleeping bags on fire
and its getting down to the wire
so grab a sofa spot and settle down awhile 

cause its getting hard to think
and my clothes are starting to shrink
and the moon is sagging down like a metal ball

and the world is a holiday
smoking in an old ashtray
they just blow it out their nose and say ok

so lets try to make this last
the past is still the past
and tomorrow is just another crazy scam
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
3. I GET LONESOME
*****I GET LONESOME***** 
This was kinda a spur of the moment type thing, but I was listening to One 
Foot In The Grave this afternoon, and this track came on, and listening I 
thought "this is easy as shit!" so I grabbed my guitar and tabbed it out. 

Intro

play that 2x 

Chorus 
4: 
5: 0 0 0 
6: 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 
play that 4x, then play the intro riff 

First solo: 
1: 2 
2: 2 x 1 0 1 1 0 0 
3: 3 x 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 
4: 0 x 0 0 0 0 0 
5: 
6: 3 3 

The second solo is just a variation on that, random arpaggiations on the 
chord progression (D7 - G). Just make stuff up. 
Hell, I'll even give you the drum transcription! The entire thing is played 
on the bass drum, so it is relatively easy... 
X = hit 

X X X X X X X X 
1 - 2 - 3 1 - 2 - 3 1 - 2 - 3 1 - 2 - 3 

Lyrics: 
Well there aint nobody left to impress 
and everyone's kissing their own hands 
its 666 on the kichen floor 
aint no fire in the pan 

i get lonesome (4x) 

so glad to be a slab 
stiff as a stick on a board 
i get thoughts and dirty socks 
piled in the corner 

i get lonesome (4x) 

Getting fat on your own fears 
bring that beer over here 
i stomp on the ground 
just to make a sound 

i get lonesome 

I'm still working on Cynide Breath Mint, and I'll probably have Steal My 
Body Home up here by the weekend... 
Later, 
John

I'm on the run with things to be (we're on the road/we're on the run)
I've got a garden hose and a color tv
I've got time on my hands
I've got time on my hands
Nobody cares what I do 

I'm on the run with things to do (we're on the road/long ago)
I've got a burnt orange peel and a potato stew
I've got work to get done
I've got work to get done
Nobody knows where to run 

I've got a quart of milk and some sound advice
I've got 
But they smell so nice
Don't give me the flu
Nobody knows I'm with you 

Back and forth I dodge a fly
Like a feather in the sky
Write me out a check
Give me all your cash
Nobody knows, so let's just go home 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
5. *****CYANIDE BREATH MINT***** 

by Beck can be found on the disc One Foot in the Grave. 
It's tuned down to D, so it's 

 D G C F A D 

I just wrote the chords down as if the guitar were in E. This seems to match 
up pretty 
well with the CD, so just listen and strum as you see fit. 
 
A F D G 
 Definitely, this is the wrong place to be 
 F C 
there's blood on the futon, 
 E A 
there's a kid drinkin' fire. 
 F 
Goin' down to the sea, 
 D G 
they got people to meet, 
 F C 
shakin' hands with themselves, 
 E F-------->slide to Gflat 
lookin' out for themselves. 

C F G 
When they ask you for credit, 
F C 
give them a branch. 
C F G 
When they want you to get it, 
F C 
chew on the grass. 
 E F 
I know, I know 
 D G 
'cause they told me to tell you 
 F C 
there's nothing to tell you, 
 E A 
there's nothing to sell you. 

(Same chords as first part) 
In the afternoon, riding the scapegoat, 
burning equipment, decomposing. 
Cool off your jets, 
take off your sweats, 
I got a funny feeling 
they got plastic in the afterlife. 

(Same chords as second part:) 
When they want you to cry, 
leap into the sky. 
When they suck your mind, 
like a pigeon you fly. 
I know, I know, 
it's the positive people 
running from their time 
looking for some feeling.

6. SEE WATER 
Close your eyes and see water
sliding up the back of your head
folding into your clothing
covering everything you said

Climb up into
Who's going to miss you

Dry up on the shoreline
drinking everything you see
offering things to the ladies
bowing down in the mossen trees

Climb up into
Nobody's going to miss you
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
7. ZIPLOCK BAG
Open up
bare me my love
ain't no cat
laying flat on the road

It's so loud
seems I've been here
ziplock bag
oh my god

Lyrics: 
 

go where you want to 
do the things you feel 
walk around with a broken leg 
and a hundred dollar bill 

get yourself a pistol 
get yourself a dog 
stay up all night gettin' drunk 
sleepin' on a hollow log 

walk till your restless 
sleep till your tired 
wake up with that (thinking?) 
your the one that I desire 
 

this TAB took me 2 hours so you better play it !!! 

I need adresses of links where I can mail-order Beck records. 
Especaily vinyl. So please send them. 
Other TAB always welcome!

9. FORCEFIELD
stand outside with a suitcase
(there's a forcefield round my neck)
walk around all the while
(and it stands just where I sat)
look at the people driving backwards
(and the stance I took on that)
no particular style
(leaves that forcefield round my back)

don't let it get near you
don't let it get too close
don't let it turn you into
(and the stance I took on that)
the things you hate the most
(leaves a forcefield round my neck)

roll out your silver-dollar coffins
pull out your buckskin gloves
tell them anything you want to
the sound comes from above

don't let it get near you
don't let it get too close 
don't let it turn you into
(and the stance I took on that)
the things you hate the most
(leaves a forcefield round my neck)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
10. FOURTEEN RIVERS FOURTEEN FLOODS
Fourteen rivers
fourteen floods
send your body to the heavens above.
Don't get drunk
don't get dry
just bring your money next Saturday night.

Forty miles on a cattle trail
with a happy mule
and nothing on my mind
all my life I've been talking fast
taking all the things
that I should have let pass.

Throw my hat on a coffee mill
put another brick
in the fire place.
Well I don't know about you or me
but some got loose
back on down.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
11. *****ASSHOLE***** 

This one was a pain to figure out since it is tuned way the hell down. 
Tuned down one and a half steps to be exact. I have seen him do this live 
and he doesn't tune down, so you don't really have to either, but if you 
want to play along with One Foot In The Grave, it's kinda neccecary.

Your brains went black when she took back her mouth

and put it out into the sun

The birds did fly when the heavens all went dry

And the cigarettes are smokin by themselves 

CHORUS 
F 
She'll do anything 
E 
She'll do anything 
A C 
She'll do anything to make you feel like an asshole 

Call her name, she looks the same as you 
question mark stretched across the skin 
She dangles carrots, makes you feel embarressed 
to be the fool you know you are

That's basically it!

13. ***** OUTCOME***** 
TABBED BY:Tom Mallon (tsmallon@syr.edu) 
 

I'm only going to do two of the parts here, the main riff and what the 
bass is playing during the chorus. I'm not going to try to figure out 
the slide bits, I would just screw around in B for those parts and see 
what you get. Here's enough to get you started though. 

MAIN VERSE RIFF 
E ------------------------------------------------------------ 
B ------------------------------------------------------------ 
G ------------------------------------------------------------ 
D -------7-6-----------4-3------------------------------------ 
A ------------------------------------------------------------ 
E ---7-------------5------------------------------------------ 
Thirteen years in the city
static clinging to the ceiling
never did I think it would come to this
how come it's different than I expected
Riot cops cheerleaders
eyebrows painted on their heads
mouthful of rotting cavities
drinking coca cola in the street
never did I think it would come to this
how come it's different than I expected
Shot in the leg
shot in the leg
my name is a bone
nobody home
my hand is a wire
the sky is on fire
the drums aren't beating
pistols in jeans
laugh at the dead
laugh at the dead
love if your dead
dead as a fly

During the chorus, the bass plays E D B, descending from the 7th fret 
on the A string. You play the E and D notes something like eight times 
each, and the B like 15 or 16. At the end of the song, the bass just 
moves up the neck from B. Enjoy.

14. *****GIRLS DREAMS***** 

>From the K Records album, One Foot In The Grave 
Transcribed by: Jarrett Frankel (jfrankel@intr.net) 
with assistance from John McCain 
Date: July 19, 1995 
 

Yet another beautiful acoustic Beck tune, from his essential independent 
release, One Foot In The Grave. It's a simple tune, so learn it quick and 
impress the one you secrectly love(you can substitue "girl" with "boy" if 
that's your gig, y'know?). Maybe they'll love you for it. 
 

(Standard tuning will work for this one, though I think it might be tuned 
down a step. Try what ever works best.) 
 

 F# A 
You're just the girl of my dreams 

 E G A B E 
But it seems my dreams never come true 

 F# A 
You're just the girl of my dreams 

 E G A B E 
But it seems my dreams never come true 

F# A E 
I first met you down on Lover's Lane 

 G A B E 
The birds were insane flapping all about 

 F# A E G 
Softly you would sing swinging in your swing 

A B E 
It wasn't night it wasn't day 
 

(repeat chorus x2) 

(silent refrain x2) 

(repeat chorus x1)

15. ******PAINTED EYELIDS******* 


Transcribed by Tim Rheome
The following is the correct (at least in my opinion) version of Painted
Eyelids by Beck from his K Records release One Foot In The Grave. (Excellent
album. Pick it up.) Anyway, I really disagree with the version on the olga
and at numerous other sites so here goes:

Intro: A (play the lowest note of the chord first then strum...just listen
to the record.)

A E
I wake up and look upon your painted eyelids

F# E (E7)
The world is your oyster and the trash bags are your kids

A E
The ceiling is invisible there's a bird sinkin thru the sky

F# E 
And every hour that passes is teachin me how to cry

D A
Cuz it's lonely here in the ugly part of town

B E (E7)
The buildings are all vacant and the telephones are down

A E
There's a police siren singing like a tiger with no skin

F# E (E7) 
The sewer drain is glowing and I don't know what state I'm in

A E 
And the river is on fire there's chemicals and debris

F# E (E7)
And all the roads are blocked off they're just too hard to see

D A
So cancel my appointments and set up a whole new show

B E
Cuz I'm in need of a good hot meal and a life to call my own

(At this point Harmonica solo plays over chord progression A-E-F#-E)

A E 
So get me a plate of money get me a blanket and a chair

F# E (E7)
The limitations are limitless they're floating thru the air

D A
Cuz it's real and it's true the things I see in you

B E
And there's nothin I wouldn't talk about with the clearest dream

A
that ever drifted by


Play A until fade out



That's it. You should get the basic idea. Just listen to the record for the
strumming pattern. Have fun.

Hope you enjoy it

16. ***ATHMOSPHERIC CONDIDTIONS*** 

By: Beck 
From: One Foot In The Grave 

Intro: 
E 

Verse: 
E - F# - A 

There's nobody there's no mountain there's no tunnel 
you can't get from there to here 
you can't get from here to there 

There's nobody there's no mountain there's no tunnel 
you can't get from there to here 
you can't get from here to there 

There hasn't been a change in the athmosphere 
 (nothing twisted round, burning down, come around) 
There hasn't been a change for over a year 
 (sliding through the water through hiding you) 
There hasn't been a change in the athmosphere 
 (shut it up, roll it up, find a new)
