TAKE ME UP TO MONTO 
by Unknown

G                     C     G              C
Well if you've got a wingo take her up to Ringo
G                 C      G   D7  G
Where the waxies sing o all the day
If you've had your fill of porter and you can't go on any further
Just give your men the order back to the quay
And take her Monto,Monto,Monto.......
CHORUS
Take her up to Monto Langeroo to you
You've heard of Butcher Foster, the dirty old imposter,
He took a mot and lost her up the Furry Glen.
He first put on his bowler, then he buttoned up his trousers,
And he whistled for a growler and he said 'My men,
Take me up to Monto, Monto, Monto.... 
The fairy told him, 'Skin the goat'; O'Donnell put him on the boat,
He wished he'd never been afloat, the dirty skite.
It wasn't very sensible to tell on the Invincibles
They took aboard the principals, day and night
Be goin' up to Monto, Monto, Monto.......
You've seen the Dublin Fusiliers, the dirty old bamboozaliers,
They went and got the childer, one, two, three,
Marchin' from the Linen Hall, there's one for every cannon ball
And Vicky's goin' to send youse all o'er the sea.
But first go up to Monto, Monto, Monto......
When the Czar of Rooshia, and the King of Prooshia
Landed in the Phoenix in a big balloon,
They asked the Garda band to play The Wearin' o' the Green
But the buggers in the depot didn't know the tune,
So they both went up to Monto, Monto, Monto......
The Queen she came to call on us, she wanted to see all of us,
I'm glad she didn't fall on us, she's eighteen stone.
'Mr. Neill, Lord Mayor,' says she, 'Is this all you've got to show to me?'
'Why no, ma'am, there's some more to see - pog mo thoin
And he took her up to Monto, Monto, Monto,
Took her up to Monto, langer oo. Liathroidi to you
