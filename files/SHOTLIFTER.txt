SHOTLIFTER

A                             G   
When I get home from work and feel so bad
C                      E7
sick from the wretched day I had
  A                    G
I sit right down in my favorite chair
    C                         E7
and drown all my fears and my dry daymares

  A                    G
  with a glass of ice, bottle of brown
  C                   E
  shotlifting til the sun goes down
  F#m                 Bm    G                      E
  my stomach feels so warm, white collar angst shotlifting will disarm
  F#m     Bm    G                        E           
  TV is a blur, conscience floats away I can't remember

If I got home from work and I had nought to drink
The news, rent and my girlfriend will give me
too much to think
so I sit right down and drink my fill
and if the pain lingers on I'll have a pill

Chorus

Next day rolls around, the fun fades away
drains from my raging in the cold work day
beckoning friend from beyond the grave
I plead someday my sanity that you will save

Chorus
