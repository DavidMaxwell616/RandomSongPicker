JAILHOUSE BLUES


    C                            A7   
Now you'll never know about the jailhouse blues 
          D7       G7              C             
'til they put you behind the four walls 
     C                    A7   
The jailhouse man turns a big black key 
     D7                      G7
and that's when your spirit falls 
     C               C7
You drag yourself up to the bars 
     F                D7/F#   
and then you gaze out at the stars, 
 C               D7  G7
that's when you see

Nobody knows about the jailhouse blues, nobody knows but me
There on the outside you all can laugh but I don't need your sympathy 
and after I've paid for what I stole 
I'll leave this place worth my weight in gold 
     C                       A7            D7      G7       C    
and nobody knows about the jailhouse blues nobody knows but me

You'll never know about the jailhouse blues until you're seated in a 2 X 4 
and you won't realize that you're all alone 
until they slam that big iron door (Lord) 
My gal she loves me, even shed a tear, 
she ain't been the same since they put me in here, 
but I'll get out some day
