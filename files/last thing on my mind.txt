        A          D            A                   E         A
It's a lesson too late for the learnin' made of sand made of sand
     A           D              A                  E         A
the blink of an eye my soul is turnin' in your hand in your hand

         E                   D            A
Are you goin' away with the words of farewell
          D         A          E         
can there be not a trace left behind
    A                   D               A              
I could have loved you better, didn't mean to be unkind,
 E                             A
that was the last thing on my mind

            A          D         A                    E             A
You've got reasons a plenty for going, please don't go please don't go
     A                D        A                 E         A
the weeds have been steadily growing, this I know this I know

(chorus)

      A         D       A                  E         A
As I lie in my bed the morning, without you without you
        A          D            A                   E         A
every song in my breast dies of mourning, without you without you

(chorus)
