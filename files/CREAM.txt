I FEEL FREE  by Jack Bruce and Pete Brown

Feel when I dance with you,
We move like the sea.
You, you're all I want to know.
I feel free, I feel free, I feel free.

I can walk down the street, there's no one there
Though the pavements are one huge crowd.
I can drive down the road; my eyes don't see,
Though my mind wants to cry out loud.

I feel free, I feel free, I feel free.

I can walk down the street, there's no one there
Though the pavements are one huge crowd.
I can drive down the road; my eyes don't see,
Though my mind wants to cry out loud,
Though my mind wants to cry out loud.

Dance floor is like the sea,
Ceiling is the sky.
You're the sun and as you shine on me,
I feel free, I feel free, I feel free.


N. S. U.  by Jack Bruce

Driving in my car, smoking my cigar,
The only time I'm happy's when I play my guitar.

Singing in my yacht, what a lot I got,
Happiness is something that just cannot be bought.

I've been in and I'm out, I've been up and down,
I don't want to go until I've been all around.

What's it all about, anyone in doubt,
I don't want to go until I've found it all out.


SLEEPY TIME TIME  by Jack Bruce and Janet Godfrey

I'm a sleepy time baby, a sleepy time boy.
Work only maybe, life is a joy.

  We'll have a sleepy time time.
  We'll have a sleepy time time.
  We'll have a sleepy time time.
  We'll have a sleepy time time.
  Sleepy time time, sleepy time all the time.

Asleep in the daytime, asleep at night.
Life is all playtime; working ain't right.

  Chorus

I have my Sunday, that ain't no lie.
But on Monday morning comes my favorite cry.

  Chorus


DREAMING  by Jack Bruce

Dreaming about my love;
You bring me joy and hours of happiness,
More or less.
I dream my life away.

Waiting for you to come;
Changing my life for you to emptyness,
Meaningless.
Minutes just drift by.

  I don't care if I get nowhere.
  I can just dream and you'll be there.
  What else is there to do?

Dreaming about my life;
Where are you now, and when will you
Come to me?
I dream my life away.

  Chorus

  First Verse

Dreaming, dreaming.


SWEET WINE  by Ginger Baker and Janet Godfrey

Who wants the worry, the hurry of city life.
Money, nothing funny; wasting the best of our life.

Sweet wine, hay making, sunshine day breaking.
We can wait till tomorrow.
Car speed, road calling, bird freed, leaf falling.
We can bide time.

  First Verse


SPOONFUL  by Willie Dixon


Could fill spoons full of diamonds,
Could fill spoons full of gold.
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Will satisfy my soul.

  Men lies about it.
  Some of them cries about it.
  Some of them dies about it.
  Everything's a-fightin' about the spoonful.
  That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful.
  That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful.
  That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful.
  That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful.

Could fill spoons full of coffee,
Could fill spoons full of tea.
Just a little spoon of your precious love;
Is that enough for me?

  Chorus

Could fill spoons full of water,
Save them from the desert sands.
But a little spoon of your forty-five
Saved you from another man.

  Chorus

FOUR UNTIL LATE  by Robert Johnson

From four until late I was wringing my hands and crying.
From four until late I was wringing my hands and crying.
I believe to my soul that your daddy's Gulfport bound.

From four until late, she made me a no good barroom clown.
From four until late, she made me a no good barroom clown.
You know she won't do nothing but tear a good man's reputation down.

A woman is like a dresser, some man always running through its drawers.
A woman is like a dresser, some man always running through its drawers.
She cause so many men to wear an apron overall.

When I leave this town I will bid you fare farewell.
When I leave this town I will bid you fare farewell.
And when I return again, you'll have a great long story to tell.

I'M SO GLAD  by Skip James

  I'm so glad, I'm so glad.  I'm glad, I'm glad, I'm glad.
  I'm so glad, I'm so glad.  I'm glad, I'm glad, I'm glad.

I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do.
I'm tired of weeping, I'm tired of moaning, I'm tired of crying for you.

  Chorus

I'm tired of weeping, I'm tired of moaning, I'm tired of groaning for you.
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do.

TOAD  by Ginger Baker

(instrumental)


THE COFFEE SONG  by Colton and Smith

There's a full time reservation
Made in a bar at the railway station,
And there's a story, a kind of fable,
On a card at the corner table.
On it is a message; been there some time.
It starts off, "The coffee tasted so fine..."

It says, "One day, this may find you,
These few words may just remind you.
We sat here together just to pass time;
You said how the coffee tasted so fine."

It goes on to say, "I love you.
If you should find this I must hear from you."
It gives a number but the name has faded away.
All that is left are just the words, "Maybe someday..."

That's the story and the fable;
Never leave alone from a corner table.
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo.
Doo doo-doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo.


WRAPPING PAPER  by Jack Bruce and Pete Brown

Wrapping paper in the gutter
Moving slowly as the wind on the sea,
(Faces calling, waves moving)
In your picture on a wall of a house of old times.
(Can you hear me)  Can you hear me
(Can you hear me)  Wandering sadly?

In the city, feeling pretty,
Down and out and making love to you on the shore,
(Ruined buildings, faces empty)
In the picture as I gaze ahead and don't see
(That they're calling)  That they're calling.
(That they're calling)  Wandering sadly.

Shattered windows, stairs to nowhere.
(Hear you calling)  Hear you calling
(Hear you calling)  As I wander so sadly.

Wish I knew what you'd done to me;
Turned me on to things I never knew.
It's all broken, weeds are growing.
Wish I was going home to the house by the shore
(Where you loved me)  Where you loved me,
(Where you loved me)  Loved me so sadly.

Someday I'll get back, somehow I'll do it.
I'll arrive there and you'll be there to meet me.
(Walk together, tread the weeds down)
Kiss again in the picture on the wall
(Where I loved you)  In the old house.
(Where I loved you)  Loved you so well.

STRANGE BREW  by Eric Clapton, Gail Collins and Felix Pappalardi

Strange brew -- kill what's inside of you.

She's a witch of trouble in electric blue,
In her own mad mind she's in love with you.
With you.
Now what you gonna do?
Strange brew -- kill what's inside of you.

She's some kind of demon messing in the glue.
If you don't watch out it'll stick to you.
To you.
What kind of fool are you?
Strange brew -- kill what's inside of you.

On a boat in the middle of a raging sea,
She would make a scene for it all to be
Ignored.
And wouldn't you be bored?
Strange brew -- kill what's inside of you.

Strange brew, strange brew, strange brew, strange brew.
Strange brew -- kill what's inside of you.


SUNSHINE OF YOUR LOVE  by Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Pete Brown

It's getting near dawn,
When lights close their tired eyes.
I'll soon be with you my love,
To give you my dawn surprise.
I'll be with you darling soon,
I'll be with you when the stars start falling.

  I've been waiting so long
  To be where I'm going
  In the sunshine of your love.

I'm with you my love,
The light's shining through on you.
Yes, I'm with you my love,
It's the morning and just we two.
I'll stay with you darling now,
I'll stay with you till my seas are dried up.

  Chorus

  Second Verse

I've been waiting so long
I've been waiting so long
I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love.


WORLD OF PAIN  by Gail Collins and Felix Pappalardi

Outside my window is a tree.
Outside my window is a tree.
There only for me.
And it stands in the gray of the city,
No time for pity for the tree or me.

  There is a world of pain
  In the falling rain
  Around me.

Is there a reason for today?
Is there a reason for today?
Do you remember?
I can hear all the cries of the city,
No time for pity for a growing tree.

  Chorus

DANCE THE NIGHT AWAY  by Jack Bruce and Pete Brown

Gonna build myself a castle
High up in the clouds.
There'll be skies outside my window;
Lose these streets and crowds.
Dance the night away.

Will find myself an ocean,
Sail into the blue,
Live with golden swordfish,
Forget the time of you.
Dance the night away.

Dance myself to nothing.
Vanish from this place.
Gonna turn myself to shadow
So I can't see your face.
Dance the night away.


BLUE CONDITION  by Ginger Baker

Don't take the wrong direction passing through
Instead of deep reflection of what's true,
For it's a combination of judgments made by you
That cause a deep dejection all the way through.

  No relaxation, no conversation, no variation
  In a very dark blue, blue condition.

Early rising every day.
You must be enterprising in your way,
For you will hear no laughter, nor see the sun;
Life would be one disaster all the way through.

  Chorus

TALES OF BRAVE ULYSSES  by Eric Clapton and Martin Sharp

You thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever,
But you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun.

And the colors of the sea blind your eyes with trembling mermaids,
And you touch the distant beaches with tales of brave Ulysses:
How his naked ears were tortured by the sirens sweetly singing,
For the sparkling waves are calling you to kiss their white laced lips.

And you see a girl's brown body dancing through the turquoise,
And her footprints make you follow where the sky loves the sea.
And when your fingers find her, she drowns you in her body,
Carving deep blue ripples in the tissues of your mind.

The tiny purple fishes run laughing through your fingers,
And you want to take her with you to the hard land of the winter.

Her name is Aphrodite and she rides a crimson shell,
And you know you cannot leave her for you touched the distant sands
With tales of brave Ulysses; how his naked ears were tortured
By the sirens sweetly singing.

The tiny purple fishes run lauging through your fingers,
And you want to take her with you to the hard land of the winter.


SWLABR  by Jack Bruce and Pete Brown

Coming to me in the morning, leaving me at night.
Coming to me in the morning, leaving me alone.
You've got that rainbow feel but the rainbow has a beard.

Running to me a-cryin' when he throws you out.
Running to me a-cryin', on your own again.
You've got that pure feel, such good responses,
But the picture has a mustache.

You're coming to me with that soulful look on your face,
Coming looking like you've never ever done one wrong thing.

You're coming to me with that soulful look on your face.
You're coming looking like you've never ever done one wrong thing.

So many fantastic colors; I feel in a wonderland.
Many fantastic colors makes me feel so good.
You've got that pure feel, such good responses.
You've got that rainbow feel but the rainbow has a beard.


WE'RE GOING WRONG  by Jack Bruce

Please open your eyes.
Try to realize.
I found out today we're going wrong,
We're going wrong.

Please open your mind.
See what you can find.
I found out today we're going wrong,
We're going wrong.

We're going wrong.
We're going wrong.
We're going wrong.


OUTSIDE WOMAN BLUES  by Arthur "Blind Willie" Reynolds

If you lose your money, great God, don't lose your mind.
If you lose your money, great God, don't lose your mind.
And if you lose your woman, please don't fool with mine.

I'm gonna buy me a bulldog, watch my lady whilst I sleep.
I'm gonna buy me a bulldog, watch my lady whilst I sleep.
'Cause women these days, they're so doggone crooked,
That they might make off 'fore day creep.

Well, you can't watch your wife and your outside women, too.
You know you can't watch your wife and your outside womens, too.
Cause when you're out with your women, your wife will be at home,
Cooking your food, doing a dirt, buddy what you trying to do?

You can't watch your wife and your outside womens, too.
You know you can't watch your wife and your outside women, too.
When you're out with your women, your wife will be at home,
Doing a dirt, cooking your food, buddy what you trying to do?


TAKE IT BACK  by Jack Bruce and Pete Brown

  Take it back, take it back, take that thing right out of here.
  Right away, far away, take that thing right out of here.

Don't let them take me to where streams are red.
I want to stay here and sleep in my own bed.
Need all your loving, long blonde hair,
Don't let them take me 'cause I'm easily scared.
Take it back, take it back, take that thing right out of here.

  Chorus

I got this great need, the need to stay alive.
Not ashamed of my creed, I've got to survive.
So come on baby, don't go away,
Just let them save me for a rainy day.
Take it back, take it back, take that thing right out of here.

I got this need, the need to stay alive.
Not ashamed of my creed, I've got to survive.
So come on baby, don't go away,
Just let them save me for a rainy day.
Take it back, take it back, take that thing right out of here.

  Chorus

I got this thing, I've got to keep it sharp.
Don't go to places where it won't shine in the dark.
So come on baby, don't go away,
Just let them save me for a rainy day.
Take it back, take it back, take that thing right out of here.


  MOTHER'S LAMENT  (traditional)

Are we rolling?  A one, a two, a three, a four...

A mother was washing her baby one night;
The youngest of ten and a delicate mite.
The mother was poor and the baby was thin;
'Twas naught but a skeleton covered with skin.

The mother turned 'round for a soap off the rack.
She was only a moment but when she turned back
Her baby had gone, and in anguish she cried,
"Oh, where has my baby gone?"  The angels replied:

Oh, your baby has gone down the plug hole.
Oh, your baby has gone down the plug.
The poor little thing was so skinny and thin,
He should have been washed in a jug, in a jug.

Your baby is perfectly happy;
He won't need a bath anymore.
He's a-muckin' about with the angels above,
Not lost but gone before.

Do you want to do it again?

ANYONE FOR TENNIS  by Eric Clapton and Martin Sharp

Twice upon a time in the valley of the tears
An auctioneer is bidding for a box of fading years
And the elephants are dancing on the graves of squealing mice.
Anyone for tennis, wouldn't that be nice?

And the ice creams are all melting on the streets of bloody beer
While the beggars stain the pavements with flourescent Christmas cheer
And the Bentley-driving guru is putting up his price.
Anyone for tennis, wouldn't that be nice?

And the prophets in the boutiques give out messages of hope
With jingle bells and fairy tales and blind colliding scopes 
And you can tell they're all the same underneath the pretty lies.
Anyone for tennis, wouldn't that be nice?

The yellow Buddhist monk is burning brightly at the zoo
You can bring a bowl of rice and then a glass of water too
And fate is setting up the chessboard while death rolls out the dice.
Anyone for tennis, wouldn't that be nice?

WHITE ROOM  by Jack Bruce and Pete Brown

In the white room with black curtains near the station.
Blackroof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings.
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes.
Dawnlight smiles on you leaving, my contentment.

I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines;
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves.

You said no strings could secure you at the station.
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows.
I walked into such a sad time at the station.
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning.

I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back;
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves.

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd.
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten.
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes.
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings.

I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd;
Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves.


SITTING ON TOP OF THE WORLD  by Chester Burnett

One summer day, she went away;
Gone and left me, she's gone to stay.
She's gone, but I don't worry:
I'm sitting on top of the world.

All the summer, worked all this fall.
Had to take Christmas in my overalls.
She's gone, but I don't worry:
I'm sitting on top of the world.

Going down to the freight yard, gonna catch me a freight train.
Going to leave this town; worked and got to home.
She's gone, but I don't worry:
I'm sitting on top of the world.


PASSING THE TIME  by Ginger Baker and Mike Taylor

It is a cold winter,
Away is the songbird.
And gone is her traveller,
She waits at home.

The sun is on holiday,
No leaves on the trees.
The animals sleep
While cold North wind blows.

The snowflakes are falling,
The roof a white blanket.
There's ice on the window pane,
She waits alone.

She sits by the fireside,
The room is so warm.
Her children are sleeping,
She waits in their home.

Passing the time.
Passing the time.
Everything fine.
Passing the time, drinking red wine.
Passing the time, drinking red wine.
Passing the time, drinking red wine.
Passing the time, everything fine.
Passing the time, drinking red wine.
Passing the time, everything fine.
Passing the time, wine and time rhyme.
Passing the time.

It is a long winter,
Away is the summer.
She waits for her traveller
So far from home.

She sits by the fireside,
The room is so warm.
There's ice on the window,
She's lonely alone.


AS YOU SAID  by Jack Bruce and Pete Brown

Let's go down to where it's clean
To see the time that might have been.
The tides have carried off the beach.
As you said,
The sun is out of reach.

Let's go back to where it's clean
To see what year it might have been.
The roads have carried off the smiles.
As you said,
To judge them at the trials.

Let's go back to now that's bad
To see the time we might have had.
The rails have carried off the trains.
As you said,
I'll never come again, again, again, again.


PRESSED RAT AND WARTHOG  by Ginger Baker and Mike Taylor

Pressed rat and warthog have closed down their shop.
They didn't want to; 'twas all they had got.
Selling atonal apples, amplified heat,
And pressed rat's collection of dog legs and feet.

Sadly they left, telling no one goodbye.
Pressed rat wore red jodhpurs, warthog a striped tie.
Between them, they carried a three-legged sack,
Went straight round the corner and never came back.

Pressed rat and warthog have closed down their shop.
The bad captain madman had told them to stop
Selling atonal apples, amplified heat,
And pressed rat's collection of dog legs and feet.

The bad captain madman had ordered their fate.
He laughed and stomped off with a nautical gate.
The gate turned into a deroga tree
And his pegleg got woodworm and broke into three.

Pressed rat and warthog have closed down their shop.
They didn't want to; 'twas all they had got.
Selling atonal apples, amplified heat,
And pressed rat's collection of dog legs and feet.


POLITICIAN  by Jack Bruce and Pete Brown

Hey now baby, get into my big black car.
Hey now baby, get into my big black car.
I want to just show you what my politics are.

I'm a political man and I practice what I preach.
I'm a political man and I practice what I preach.
So don't deny me baby, not while you're in my reach.

I support the left, though I'm leaning, leaning to the right.
I support the left, though I'm leaning to the right.
But I'm just not there when it's coming to a fight.

Hey now baby, get into my big black car.
Hey now baby, get into my big black car.
I want to just show you what my politics are.


THOSE WERE THE DAYS  by Ginger Baker and Mike Taylor

When the city of Atlantis stood serene above the sea,
Long time before our time when the world was free,
Those were the days.

Golden cymbals flying on ocarina sounds,
Before wild Medusa's serpents gave birth to hell
Disguised as heaven.

  Those were the days, yes they were, those were the days.
  Those were their ways, miracles everywhere are they now?
  They're gone.
  Those were their ways, yes they were, those were their ways.
  Those were the days, yes they were, those were the days.

Tie your painted shoes and dance, blue daylight in your hair,
Overhead a noiseless eagle fans a flame.
Wonder everywhere.

  Chorus


BORN UNDER A BAD SIGN  by Booker T. Jones and William Bell

  Born under a bad sign.
  I've been down since I began to crawl.
  If it wasn't for bad luck,
  I wouldn't have no luck at all.

Bad luck and trouble's my only friend.
I've been down ever since I was ten.

  Chorus

You know, wine and women is all I crave.
A big bad woman's gonna carry me to my grave.

  Chorus

  First Verse

Born under a bad sign.

Born under a bad sign.

DESERTED CITIES OF THE HEART  by Jack Bruce and Pete Brown

Upon this street where time has died.
The golden treat you never tried.
In times of old, in days gone by.
If I could catch your dancing eye.

  It was on the way,
  On the road to dreams, yeah.
  Now my heart's drowned in no love streams, yeah.

The street is cold, its trees are gone.
The story's told the dark has won.
Once we set sail to catch a star.
We had to fail, it was too far.

  Chorus

I felt the wind shout like a drum.
You said, "My friend, love's end has come."
It couldn't last, had to stop.
You drained it all to the last drop.

  Chorus

Now my heart's drowned in no love streams, yeah.

On this dark street the sun is black.
The winter life is coming back.
On this dark street it's cold inside.
There's no retreat from time that's died.

It was on the way,
On the road to dreams, yeah.
Now my heart's drowned in no love streams, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Now my heart's drowned in no love streams, yeah.
Now my heart's drowned in no love.


CROSSROADS  by Robert Johnson

I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees.
I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees.
Asked the Lord above for mercy, "Save me if you please."

I went down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride.
I went down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride.
Nobody seemed to know me, everybody passed me by.

I'm going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side.
I'm going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side.
You can still barrelhouse, baby, on the riverside.

You can run, you can run, tell my friend-boy Willie Brown.
You can run, you can run, tell my friend-boy Willie Brown.
And I'm standing at the crossroads, believe I'm sinking down.

---------------------------------------------------

BADGE  by Eric Clapton and George Harrison

Thinkin' 'bout the times you drove in my car.
Thinkin' that I might have drove you too far.
And I'm thinkin' 'bout the love that you laid on my table.

I told you not to wander 'round in the dark.
I told you 'bout the swans, that they live in the park.
Then I told you 'bout our kid, now he's married to Mabel.

Yes, I told you that the light goes up and down.
Don't you notice how the wheel goes 'round?
And you better pick yourself up from the ground
Before they bring the curtain down,
Yes, before they bring the curtain down.

Talkin' 'bout a girl that looks quite like you.
She didn't have the time to wait in the queue.
She cried away her life since she fell off the cradle.


DOING THAT SCRAPYARD THING  by Jack Bruce and Pete Brown

When I was young they gave me a mongrel piano,
Spent all my time inventing the cup of tea.
Writing your name in the sea,
Banging my favorite head.

Missing the last bed, waving the cheery herring,
Balancing brass bands on the tip of my toe.
Phoning your home from a tree,
Drinking my favorite loch.

When I was old they gave me a model factory,
I met three salads out on the motorway.
Leaving your name at the door,
Breaking my favorite egg.

Missing the walrus, sharing my last banana,
Balancing zeppelins on the end of my nose.
Calling your name in the zoo,
Blowing my favorite mind.


WHAT A BRINGDOWN  by Ginger Baker

Dainties in a jam-jar, parson's colour in the sky.
Water in a fountain doesn't get me very high.
Moby Dick and Albert making out with Captain Bligh.
So you know what you know in your head.
Will you, won't you, do you, don't you know when a head's dead?
What a bringdown!

Winter leader Lou is grownin' 'Ampsteads in the North.
Betty B's been wearin' daisies since the twenty-fourth.
Wears a gunner when there's one more coming forth.
And you know what you know in your head.
Will you, won't you, do you, don't you wanna go to bed?
What a bringdown!

There's a tea-leaf about in the family,
Full of nothin' their fairy tale.
There's a tea-leaf a-floatin' now for Rosalie,
They'll believe in ding-dong bell.

Take a butchers at the dodginesses of old Bill.
Aristotle's orchestra are living on the pill.
One of them gets very very prickly when he's ill.
And you know what you know in your head.
Will you, won't you, do you, don't you wanna make more bread?
What a bringdown!

You wanna love another man.
