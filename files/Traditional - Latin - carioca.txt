      Say, have you seen a Carioca?
      It's not a foxtrot or a polka
      It has a little bit of new rhythm
      A blue rhythm that sighs
      It has a meter that is tricky
      A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
      But when you dance it with a new love
      There's a true love in her eye

      You dream of a new Carioca
      Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
      You dream of a new Carioca
      When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

      Two heads together, they say are better than one
      Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
      Two arms around you and lips
      That's why I'm yours and you are mine
      And you are mine

      Now that you've done the Carioca
      You'll never care to do the Polka
      And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

      Tomorrow morning you'll discover
      You're just a Carioca lover
      And when you dance it with each new love
      There'll be true love just for you

      Now you'll dream of a new Carioca
      Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
      You'll dream of a new Carioca
      When music and lights are gone and we're saying goodbye
      Goodbye
