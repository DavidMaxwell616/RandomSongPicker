DRUNK AND FAMOUS - words by erich

    G            C                E          G        C         E
My once tender, fleecy shades of green have turned a temporary blue. 
Soon, I fear, to turn the hazy shades for now the blues give way to soon
B           F          B                     F         A     
For now, I tremble in rage. My fingers are cigarette stained.
Em       G                   D           
Growing must be fought, the message it screams. 
Dm                      Dm/F      A7
I've stepped out of the green too soon. 
Em             G    D           
In throwing myself upon the flame, 
  Dm          Dm/F    A7           D      D9/C
I insure not only my doom but my fame.

Once you're ahead, where can you go? 
Fame has won me countless friends, 
yet I sit here, all alone. 
My eyes watch the leaves out in the street.
Autumn has descended like a dream, 
the greens of summer are now obscene
Now my life is burning away,
too drunk to fear dying, the awful void looks okay.
For the rest who follow, the void will not look the same.
In the all engulfing black there will be a single,
receding flame. 

The light is fading from the sky,
every night is longer than the last. 
Soon it will be my time to die 
but first let us have another glass. 
When winter comes and fall fades, 
as it always does and we will always rage. 
Like leaves that fall from a dying drying tree, 
Ashes from a cigarette on your floor. 
We'll softly drop down into a jug of whiskey, 
for my love and summer are no more
