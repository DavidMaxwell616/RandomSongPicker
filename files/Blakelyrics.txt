(All my life I've been a travelin' man)2X
Stayin' alone and doin' the best I can
(Shipped my trunks down to Tennessee)2X
Hard to tell about a man like me
(Met a gal couldn't get her off my mind)2X
She passed me up, said she couldn't take my kind
(I'm afraid to bother around her house at night)2X
She's got a policedog that's craving for a fight
(His name is Rambler and when he gets a chance)2X
He leaves his mark on everybody's pants
(Guess I'm gonna travel now, guess I'll let her be)2X

6. Hard Pushin' Papa - G
I come to town and I come to stay 
Better look out women when I come your way
     Cause I'm a hard pushin' papa don't know  when to stop
      I'm a hard pushin' papa push you til you drop
Listen all you fellas I'm back to stay
Steal all your lovin' and haul your grain
Three years pullman porter never lost a bet
Three years in jail and I ain't done yet
If you wanna fight you soon will see
A cat and dog ain't got a thing on me
I'm rough and tumble and never been to school 
nobody comes near me cause I break all the rules
Take my liquor standing up my women sittin' down
Man cross my path I'm gonna run him out of town
Never used a razor pistol or knife in a fight
Take one look at a man and he'll lay down and die
Don't get desperate mama when I tell you true
You'll like my size, sweet jellyroll to you
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

(Sure is funny how hard a man can fall)2X
