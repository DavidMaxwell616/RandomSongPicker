i've seen way too many requests for this song.

and i've posted it twice

so here is the final time that i will post "i will survive" by cake

intro:
(chords are actually played more than 4 times, this is just the space
saving version, you should get the idea)
  Am      Dm      G       C       F       B        E
e----------------------------------------------------------
b----------------------------------------------------------
g---------7-7-7-7---------5-5-5-5---------4-4-4-4--1-1-1-1-
d-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-3-3-3-3-4-4-4-4--2-2-2-2-
a-7-7-7-7-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-2-2-2-2--2-2-2-2-
e-5-5-5-5---------3-3-3-3---------1-1-1-1----------0-0-0-0-


verses and chorus:(i'm not so sure 'bout the lyrics)

Am
at first i was afraid
Dm
i was petrified
G
i kept thinking i could never live
C
without you by my side
F
then i spent so many nights
B
just thinking how you did me wrong
E
i grew strong
E
i learned how to get along

you get the idea...

etc...
