Gene Austin - Cheer Up Little Sister

Cheer Up little sister
a new day is dawning
you'll feel better in the morning
when trouble hits ya don't let it get ya
you'll feel better in the morning
and when the sun comes creeping over the hill
say you'll be feeling better you can bet your boots you will
Cheer Up little sister
a new day is dawning
you'll feel better in the morning
