Bob Dylan - Don't think twice
Transcribed by Ben Duckworth, 18-11-99;

 Play it with the Capo on the 4th fret.

C                       G7             Am
Well it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
F                        C        G7
  If'n you don't know by now.
   C                G7             Am
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe.
D7/F#                    G7
   It'll never do, some-how.

         C                    C7
When the rooster crows at the break of dawn
F                           D7/F#
   look out your window and I'll be gone
C          G7          Am        F
You're the reason I'm travelin' on,
    C           G7              C
but don't think twice, it's al-right.



VERSE 2:
Ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe,
That light I never knowed.
Ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe,
I'm on the dark side of the road.

Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say,
To try & make me change my mind and stay.
We never did too much talkin' anyway,
So don't think twice, it's all right.


VERSE 3:
It ain't no use in callin out my name, gal
Like you never done before.
It ain't no use in callin out my name, gal
I can't hear anymore

I'm sittin & a wonderin, walkin down the road
I once loved a woman - a child I am told
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul
but don't think twice, it's alright.



VERSE 3:
So lo-ong honey babe
where I'm bound, I can't tell.
Goodbye is too good a word babe.
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."

I ain't sayin you treated me unkind
You coulda done better but, I don't mind
You just kind of wasted my precious time
but don't think twice, it's alright.
