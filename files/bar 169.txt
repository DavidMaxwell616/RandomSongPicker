1. GRETA

(I'd ask her out again and again
she's gonna return my calls
I ask her to move closer
get no response at all)2x

(and I know I should know better
than to fall in love with Greta)2x

gracious greta sweet and kind and so divine
make my life out with a brunch on a Sunday 
there's nothing better
than when I see this girl
she walked my way and she's smiling

there she goes
she's like no other
the difference she will make
she just turn me out
there she goes
she there is no other
the difference she will make
she just turns me out

when i hold the camera
and try to make her smile
she makes me melt
as her hair falls in her eyes
and I can't contain it
I lose my cool
I tell her that I want her

what I do for you
yeah my heart is true
making no excuse girl
all I want is you
like dominoes we fall
as we watch her walk down the hall
my heart it beats with her name
heart it knows no shame

2. PROPHETS SAY

sweet ever peace she holds my head
smiles and whispers helps me look away
deny the crimes to laugh and pass and sigh 
sweet athena ever knowing eye

let the prophets lead the way say
watch the dam break down
prophets cannot save face
watch the people go now
and now she leads the way say
everybody wants her
and now you hear them say
everybody loves her

dream state my feet are made of lead
cannot seem to save us anyway
angry nature waves are crashing down
escape is narrow nerves are tightly wound

chorus



3. DON'T WANNA KNOW

Have I always have to be watching over you
and I can't be thinking about every single thing you do
known you oh so long
can't be leaving you alone
mama said baby what you gonna do

told your mama that I was was your alibi
told your mama that you weren't with me last night 
when she calls your house
and I find you were out
mama said baby what you gonna do

give her everything
give her everything she wants
but don't tell me
cause I don't want to know
give her everything she wants
but don't tell me
cause I don't want to know

I ask you would you rather be with him
you call me crazy say we're just friends
when I ask about how this all went down

tell me big old lies let me close my eyes

save it for someone who understands

as I sit transfixed 
my eyes on the bottle
my mind is locked on you 
I obsess a madness of sorts
a drunken mess of course

leapin in I immerse myself
as the waves of endorphines rush
between the clouds of adversity
I've arrived with my heart on my sleeve
so we talk off on this ride
on a motorcycle she's wrapped around my insides
quoting elliot "we spread against the sky"
text messages "I want you I want you tonight"

She's my library spider
I wanna get entwined by her
She is my library spider
try and try to hide from her

Once she's had her fix
cure of passing obsession
It's back to work on the web
she'll confess a madness of sorts
a drunken mess of course

Leaping out she divests herself
and she cries for a moment she's too sure
convinced herself "he's not for me
not my kind for my station in life
and so she turns back to the archives
eating focalin and coffee she's up all night
quoting derrida she draws me into fights
postmodern babe she changes me out 


6. WHY DO WE FIGHT

conscience and patience darling
that is what we need yeah darling
making soldiers out of children darling
send them off to war darling

why do we fight
when we can move on

there's much to be forgiven
there's much to be forgot
the peace we have together
was much more than the war


as we move along
you would think that we would learn while healing
our movement is strong
you would think that we would learn while healing
the people to get organized
got to stop them now

After hours electrified she goes
barely ripe with fortunes yet untold
she keeps playing that song for me again and again
play it one more time she don't want it to end

so I see the truth behind her eyes
she cries she's alive for a moment now
feel the pain of her disguise
she cries she's alive for a moment now

after all the coke is done and gone
she's paranoid that she's the only one
she keeps playing that song for me again and again
play it one more time she don't want it to end
She said do-do-you-do-do
who-oh-oh-oh-oh

chorus

from the moment she arise she's my
dominatix in disguise
she's my angel with the black wings

She said do-do-you-do-do
who-oh-oh-oh-oh
