Spicy Treat

E                                    D
See that girl with the glint in her eye
                   C 
She lights up the room with hint of a smile
           E
and she's mine

She's no confection no sweet petite
she's a spicy treat
she's trouble and she's mine

 Am                                                    G
She's the kind of girl that doesn't take no for an answer
     F                                   A
she won't let rejection roll off of her back
      G                  B7
she broke me in half I thought I'd die
                          C               B7        
Now I know she's my only true friend and why

She doesn't pretend and fake sympathy
she makes me breathe
she's tough and she's mine

she's got sense and she uses it well
keeps her feet on the ground when I lose my mind

she knows me well and makes me smile
for eyes like her I'd swim the nile
and she's mine

When I die I want her there
one last chance to smell her hair
cause she's mine

she doesn't let liars have their way
she makes them pay
she's nuts and she's mine
