            Dm           G
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
   C           Am
Tomorrow I'll miss you
    F           Dm       Bb   G7
Remember I'll always be true
          Dm        G
And then while I'm away
           C          Am
I'll write home every day
           F          G7        C
And I'll send all my loving to you

        Dm             G
I'll pretend that I'm kissing 
     C          Am
the lips I am missing
    F             Dm               Bb   G7
And hope that my dreams will come true
          Dm        G
And then while I'm away
            C          Am
I'll write home every day
           F          G7        C
And I'll send all my loving to you

CHORUS:
         Am     Ad7           C
All my loving I will send to you
          Am    Ad7             C
All my loving, darling I'll be true

VERSE ONE
CHORUS

         C#m            E
All my loving, all my loving 
           C#m   
Woo all my loving

I will send to you
