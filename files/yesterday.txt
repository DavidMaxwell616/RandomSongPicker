Yesterday,
            B7                          Em          Em/D    C               
All my troubles seemed so far away,
            D7                               G5                G/F# 
Now it looks as though they're here to stay,
      Em7   A7           C   G5      
Oh,   I     believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
I'm not half the man I used to be,
There's a shadow hanging over me,
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.

B7sus  B7  Em    D    C
Why    she  had   to   go,
Em/B          Am6           D        G5
I        don't know, she wouldn't say.
I  said something wrong,
Now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday,
Love was such an easy game to play,
Now I need a place to hide away,
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

Why she had to go,
I don't know, she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong,
Now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday,
Love was such an easy game to play,
Now I need a place to hide away,
Oh, I believe in yesterday.
