Cm       G#/C          D#                Dm  G/D
Children play  in the park  they don't know
Cm   G#/C          D#          Dm  G/D
I'm alone in the dark  even though
Cm        A#        D#      G#          G     
Time and time again I see your face smilin' inside

(CHORUS)
   D#        C#   G#  D#           C#     G#
     I'm so happy        that you love me
   D#        C#   G#  D#           C#     G#
     life is lovely       when you're near me
    D#       Cm                A#               G#
    Tell me you will stay     Make me smile

(verse 2)
Livin' life   is just a game  so they say
All the games we used to play  fade away
We may now enjoy the dreams we shared
so long ago

(Chorus 2)
Oh my darlin'  got to have you
feel the magic   when I hold you
Cry sweet tears of joy  touch the sky


(chorus 3)
Now I need you   more than ever
no more cryin'  we're together
Tell me you will stay   Make me smile
