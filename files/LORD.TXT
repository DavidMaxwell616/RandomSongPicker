3. Lord Only Knows:

[scream]Ahhhhhhhhhh!!

[spoken in background:] "pull out the big one, too.....nice."

C                A    
You only got one finger left
         F               C  
And it's pointing at the door
And you're taking for granted
What the Lord's laid on the floor

So I'm picking up the pieces
And I'm putting them up for sale
Throw your meal ticket out the window
Put your skeletons in jail

G                                   C
'Cause Lord only knows it's getting late
G                                 C
Your senses are gone so don't you hesitate
F                  A             C              A
To give yourself a call let your bottom dollars fall
Ab                    G              C
Throwing your two bit cares down the drain

Invite me to the seven seas like some seasick man
You will do whatever you please and I'll do whatever I can
Titantic, fare thee well, my eyes are turning pink
Don't call us when the new age gets old enough to drink

'Cause Lord only knows it's getting late
Your senses are gone so don't you hesitate
Move on up the hill there's nothing dead left to kill
Throwing your two bit cares down the drain

Aurele, aurele, aurele, aurele*
Aurele, aurele
Just passing through

Aurele, aurele, aurele, aurele

Going back to Houston
Do the hotdog dance
Going back to Houston
To get me some pants.....

*In the recent CMJ article, Beck says the original title of the song was 
"Aurele"(a Chicano exclamatory slang, which according to Beck is "somewhere 
between [the meaning's of] 'salut' or 'l'chaim' ") but the engineer heard 
the chorus wrong and wrote down "O-de-lay".  In the end, Beck liked the 
way "Odelay" looked better. So, really, he is intending to say "Aurele".
