3 PIECE HAIRCUT
A F D

Trying to catch my second wind a fair friend to abide
Lost my reason in a poker hand an improvised plan from inside

3 piece haircut, empty and loud
flashpan poser make your mama proud

Creeping darkness and damaged goods better knock on wood and prepare
Running your mouth and talking in tongues climbing your rungs to nowhere

chorus

Cagey tosser with a drama fetish bedside issues to spare
Money junky in a rumor mill a shroomer thrill with no cares

chorus

Stomach knots are calling the shots curdled cream of the crop
pull your punches and power lunches follow your hunches to the top
