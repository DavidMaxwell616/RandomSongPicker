BRUCE'S PHILOPSHER'S SONG
Eric Idle

  F       
Immanuel Kant was a real pissant
                     C7
Who was very rarely stable.

Heidegger, Heidegger was a boozy beggar
                                F
Who could think you under the table.

David Hume could out-consume
                   Bb
Wilhelm Freidrich Hegel,
 
     C7
And Wittgenstein was a beery swine
                               F
Who was just as schloshed as Schlegel.

                 C7
There's nothing Nietzche couldn't teach ya
'Bout the raising of the wrist.
A7         Bb7            B7        C7
Socrates, himself, was permanently pissed.

John Stuart Mill, of his own free will,
On half a pint of shandy was particularly ill.

Plato, they say, could stick it away--
Half a crate of whisky every day.

Aristotle, Aristotle was a bugger for the bottle.
Hobbes was fond of his dram,

And René Descartes was a drunken fart.
'I drink, therefore I am.'

Yes, Socrates, himself, is particularly missed,
A lovely little thinker,
But a bugger when he's pissed.
