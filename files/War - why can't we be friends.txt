D                         C#
I've seen you round for a long long time
Bm7    Asus      E
I remembered you when you drank my wine

CHORUS

I've seen you walking down in Chinatown
I called ya but ya could not look around

CHORUS

I paid my money to the welfare line
I see you standing in it every time

CHORUS

The color of your skin don't matter to me
As long as we can live in harmony

CHORUS

I'd kind of like to be the President
So I can show ya how your money's spent

CHORUS

Sometimes I don't speak right
But yet I know what I'm talking about

CHORUS

I know you're working for the CIA
They wouldn't have you in the Maf-I-A

CHORUS
