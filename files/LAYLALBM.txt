Just you wait and see
We'll be walking
Together hand in hand along the way, love
Hope it's still me

Our love is gonna keep on growing and growing
and it's all because of you ...CHORUS TWICE
LONG SOLO ON:   A    D    A    D


4. NOBODY KNOWS YOU WHEN YOU'RE DOWN AND OUT  by Jimmie Cox

C                E7               A
Once I lived the life of a millionaire,
Dm           A                 Dm       A
Spent all my money, I just did not even care.
F           F#dim             C           A
Took all my friends out for a mighty good time,
D7                         G7
Bought bootleg whisky, champagne and wine.

Then I began to fall so low,
Lost all my good friends, I did not have nowhere to go.
I get my hands on a dollar again,
I'm gonna hang on to it till that eagle grins.

'Cause no, no, nobody knows you
When you're down and out.
In your pocket, not one penny,
And as for friends, you don't have any.

When you finally get back up on your feet again,
Everybody wants to be your old long-lost friend.
Said it's mighty strange, without a doubt,
Nobody knows you when you're down and out.

When you finally get back upon your feet again,
Everybody wants to be your good old long-lost friend.
Said it's mighty strange,
Nobody knows you,
Nobody knows you,
Nobody knows you when you're down and out.

You've got to be a fool to understand 
To bring your woman back home
After she's left you for another
You've got to be a, you've got to be a man ...CHORUS

          A          E            D                       D7  
I got the key to the highway, I'm booked out and bound to go, 
          A          E                    A    E
I'm gonna leave here running, ain't coming back no more

I'm going back to the border, where I'm better known, 
I'm gonna ride this old highway, ain't coming back no more

Give me one more kiss, mama, just before I go, 
I'm gonna leave here running, ain't coming back no more

Now, when the moon peeks over the mountain, yeah.. 
You know I'll be on my way I'm gonna walk, walk this ol' highway, 
deep until the break of day

So long and good-bye, yes, I had to say good-bye,
'Cause I'm gonna walk, walk this ol' highway, deep 'til the day I die

  Live Verse:
When the moon peeks over the mountains I'll be on my way.
I'm gonna roam this old highway Until the break of day.

Oh give me one, one more kiss mama
Just before I go,
'Cause when I leave this time you know I,
I won't be back no more.

  TELL THE TRUTH  by Eric Clapton and Bobby Whitlock

Tell the truth.  Tell me who's been fooling you?
Tell the truth.  Who's been fooling who?

There you sit there, looking so cool

A new dawn is breaking now.  Can't you see it?

Tell the truth.  Tell me who's been fooling you

  WHY DOES LOVE GOT TO BE SO SAD  by Eric Clapton and Bobby Whitlock

Got to find me a way
Dm                 C
Take me back to yesterday
Bb           F               A
How could I ever hope to forget you?

Won't you show me a place
Dm                   C
Where I can hide my lonely face?

Why does love got to be so sad?
D                        G
Why does love got to be so sad?

Like a moth to a flame
Like a song without a name
I've never been the same since I met you
Like a bird on the wing
I've got a brand new song to sing
I can't keep from singing about you ...CHORUS

I'm beginning to see
What a fool you've made of me
I might have to break the law when I find you
Stop running away
I've got a better game to play
You know I can't go on living without you ...CHORUS


  HAVE YOU EVER LOVED A WOMAN  by Billy Myles

Have you ever loved a woman so much you tremble in pain?
Have you ever loved a woman so much you tremble in pain?
And all the time you know she bears another man's name.

But you just love that woman so much it's a shame and a sin.
You just love that woman so much it's a shame and a sin.
But all the time you know she belongs to your very best friend.

Have you ever loved a woman and you know you can't leave her alone?
Have you ever loved a woman and you know you can't leave her alone?
Something deep inside of you won't let you wreck your best friend's home.


  LITTLE WING  by Jimi Hendrix
           Em                  G 
Well she's walking through the clouds
       Am                          Em7  
With a circus mind that's running 'round.
Bm                         Bbm                 G
Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams and fairy tales,
F                   C      D
That's all she ever thinks about.

When I'm sad she comes to me
With a thousand smiles she gives to me free.
Said, "It's all right, take anything you want,
Anything you want, anything."

  Second Verse

Fly on, little wing.

  THORN TREE IN THE GARDEN  by Bobby Whitlock

Emaj7                                       F#m/E   
There's a thorn tree in the garden, if you know just what I mean
      Emaj7                               F#m/E
And I hate to hurt your feelings but its not the way it seems

'Cause I miss her 
           Emaj7                          F#m/E
She's the only girl I've cared for, the only one I've known
     Emaj7                        F#m/E 
And no one ever shared more love than we've known 
       Emaj7    E7
And I miss her 
        A
But it all seems so strange to see
Emaj7
That she'd never turn her back on me
 A          B7              E7
And leave without a last goodbye 
 A
And if she winds up walking the streets
 Emaj7
Loving every other man she meets

Who'll be the one to answer why?
