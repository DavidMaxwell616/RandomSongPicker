  HAD TO CRY TODAY  by Steve Winwood

It's already written that today will be one to remember.
The feeling's the same as being outside of your door.

  Had to cry today.
  Well I saw your sign and I missed you there.

I'm taking the chance to see the wind in your eyes while I listen.
You say you can't reach me but you want everyone to be free.

  CAN'T FIND MY WAY HOME  by Steve Winwood
     D             D/C        D/B             D/Bb
Come down off your throne and leave your body alone.
F   G         D
Somebody must change.
You are the reason I've been waiting so long.
Somebody holds the key.

  But I'm near the end and I just ain't got the time 
  And I'm wasted and I can't find my way home.

Come down on your own and leave your body alone.
Somebody must change.
You are the reason I've been waiting all these years.
Somebody holds the key.

  Chorus

But I can't find my way home.
But I can't find my way home.
But I can't find my way home.
But I can't find my way home.
Still I can't find my way home,
And I ain't done nothing wrong,
But I can't find my way home.


  WELL ALL RIGHT  by Norman Petty, Buddy Holly, Jerry Allison and Joe B. Mauldin
D                  C         D
Well all right, so I've been foolish.
Well all right, let people know
About the dreams and wishes that you wish
In the night when lights are low.

  Well all right, well all right,
  You know we live and love with all our might.
  Well all right, well all right,
  You know our lifetime love will be all right.

Well all right, so I'm not working.
Well all right, let people say
That those foolish kids can't be ready
For the love that comes their way.

  PRESENCE OF THE LORD  by Eric Clapton

I have finally found a way to live just like I never could before.
I know that I don't have much to give, but I can open any door.
Everybody knows the secret, everybody knows the score.
I have finally found a way to live in the color of the Lord.

I have finally found a place to live just like I never could before.
And I know I don't have much to give, but soon I'll open any door.
Everybody knows the secret, everybody knows the score.
I have finally found a place to live in the presence of the Lord.
In the presence of the Lord.

I have finally found a way to live just like I never could before.
And I know I don't have much to give, but I can open any door.
Everybody knows the secret, I said everybody knows the score.
I have finally found a way to live in the color of the Lord.
In the color of the Lord.


  SEA OF JOY  by Steve Winwood

Following the shadows of the skies,
Or are they only figments of my eyes?
And I'm feeling close to when the race is run.
Waiting in our boats to set sail.
Sea of joy.

Once the door swings open into space,
And I'm already waiting in disguise.
Is it just a thorn between my eyes?
Waiting in our boats to set sail.
Sea of joy.

Having trouble coming through,
Through this concrete blocks my view
And it's all because of you.

Oh, is it just a thorn between my eyes?
Waiting in our boats to set sail.
Sea of joy.

Sea of joy.
Sea of joy.
Sailing free.
Sea of joy.


  DO WHAT YOU LIKE  by Ginger Baker

Do right, use your head.
Everybody must be fed.
Get together, break your bread.
Yes, together, that's what I said.
Do what you like.

Don't fight, use your head.
It's all right every night.
Do what you like, that's what I said.
Everybody must be fed.
Do what you like.

Open your eyes.
Realize you're not dead.
Take a look at an open book.
Do what you like, that's what I said.
Do what you like.
