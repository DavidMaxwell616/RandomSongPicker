Brown asshead and his ice cutter brother

younger than ice cube but

rougher than butter

Don't try to raise kids 
if you marry for money 
and don't blame me 
if they start acting funny
I believe in X but I don't believe in y
I would start bawling 
but my eyes are much too dry

I'm getting really hungry 
I don't want to cook 
not ready for a gamble 
and I don't want to look.
Glare down from your perch daddy 
inside you are beamin 
some died in their boots, 
some died in their semen 

Now that you are young 
with no offspring in the air 
listen and learn from the dude 
with the boot in his hair
He's convinced you to kill, 
can't convince you to care 
corneas splatter 
and you just sit there and stare
