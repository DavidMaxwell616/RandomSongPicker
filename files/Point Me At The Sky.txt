Hey, Jean
This is Henry McClean
And I've finished my beautiful flying machine

And I'm ringing to say
That I'm leaving and maybe
You'd like to fly with me
And hide with me, baby

Isn't it strange
How little we change
Isn't it sad we're insane
Playing the games that we know end in tears
The games we've been playing
For thousands and thousands and thousands

Pointing to this cosmic glider
Pull this plastic glider higher
And light the fuse and stand right back, he cried
This is my last goodbye

Point me at the sky and let it fly
Point me at the sky and let it fly
Point me at the sky and let it fly

And if you survive till two thousand and five
I hope you're exceedingly thin
For if you are stout you will have to breathe out
While the people around you breathe in

People pressing on me is
Always something that I've hated
So is sitting down to eat with
Only little capsules on my plate

Point me at the sky and let it fly
Point me at the sky and let it fly
Point me at the sky and let it fly

And all we've got to say to you is goodbye
???, It's goodbye
???, It's goodbye
It's time to go, better run and get your bags, It's goodbye
Nobody cry, It's goodbye
Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye
Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye
Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye
