Moon River
==========
music Henry Mancini, lyrics Johnny Mercer

Transcribed by Graham Hawkins (ghawkins@comp.vuw.ac.nz)

This song is from the movie Breakfast At Tiffany's. It won the 
Oscar for Best Song in 1961, and also Best Score. As you probably
know the song was sung by Audrey Hepburn, and BTW her fingering 
was spot on! :-)

All tab and lyrics are as I hear them in the film. 

F    Dm    Bb           F/A
Moon River wider than a mile,
     Bb              F/A      Em7b5  A7 
I'm crossin' you in style, some day.
    Dm F7/C        Bb    Eb9
Oh Dreammaker you heartbreaker,
    Dm         Bm7b5  E7       Am7 D7      Gm7  C7
Wherever  your    go-in', I'm  go-in' your way.

F     Dm     Bb             F/A
Two drifters off to see the world;
        Bb            F/A         Em7b5  A7 
There's such a lot of world   to see.
Dm       F7/C     Bm7b5  Bb7b9         F
We're   af-ter the same   rainbow's   end,
  Bb              F      Bb              F
Waitin' round the bend, my huckleberry friend.
 Dm    Bb  C7        *  
Moon River   and me.
