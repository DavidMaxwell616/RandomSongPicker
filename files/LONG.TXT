    Cm                   Ab/Bb       Eb   Eb7      Ab
The long and winding road      that leads to your door
     Gm         Cm    Fm             Bb7     Db/Eb             
Will never disappear, I've seen that road before   
Ab  Gm          Cm      Fm       Bb7             Eb
It always leads me here,    lead me to your door

    Cm                 Ab/Bb           Eb   Eb7      Ab
The wild and windy night     that the rain washed away
     Gm     Cm           Fm          Bb7     Db/Eb             
Has left a pool of tears     crying for the day       
Ab  Gm                Cm      Fm        Bb7          Eb
Why leave me standing here?      Let me know the way

Eb/Bb                 Ab        Eb/G            Fm    Bb7      
Many times I've been alone and many times I've cried   
Eb/Bb         Ab             Eb/G            Fm    Bb7      
Anyway you'll never know the many ways I've tried   

    Cm                     Ab/Bb            Eb      Eb7    Ab        
But still they lead me back       to the long and winding road 
     Gm         Cm        Fm      Bb7              Db/Eb
You left me standing here      a long, long time ago       
Ab       Gm           Cm      Fm       Bb7            Eb  
   Don't leave me waiting here,   lead me to your door


Eb/Bb                 Ab        Eb/G            Fm    Bb7      
Eb/Bb                 Ab        Eb/G            Fm    Bb7      

                                                                                      

    Cm                     Ab/Bb            Eb      Eb7    Ab        
But still they lead me back       to the long and winding road 
     Gm         Cm        Fm      Bb7              Db/Eb
You left me standing here      a long, long time ago       
Ab       Gm           Cm      Fm       Bb7            Eb  
   Don't leave me waiting here,   lead me to your door
