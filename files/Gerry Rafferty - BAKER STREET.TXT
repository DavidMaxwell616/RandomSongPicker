Title:				BAKER STREET		(Gerry Rafferty)
		A
		Winding your way down on Baker Street

		Lite in your head, and dead on your feet
		      Em                    G
		Well another crazy day, you drink the night away
		       D
		And forget about everything

		A
		This city desert makes you feel so cold, its got

		So many people but its got no soul
		        Em                   G
		And its taken you so long to find out you were wrong
		         D
		When you thought it held everything.

		Dm7                           Am7
		You used to think that it was so easy
		Dm7                         Am7
		You used to say that it was so easy
		    C             G            D
		But you're tryin, you're tryin now
		Dm7                         Am7
		Another year and then you'd be happy
		Dm7                               Am7
		Just one more year and then you'd be happy
		    C              G            A
		But you're cryin', you're cryin now

		A
		Way down the street there's a light in his place

		You open the door, he's got that look on his face
		       Em                              G
		And he asks you where youv'e been, you tell him who you've seen
		        D
		And you talk about anything

		A		
		He's got this dream about buyin' some land

		He's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands
		    Em                             G
		And then he'll settle down, it's a quiet little town
		       D
		And forget about everything

		Dm7                       Am7
		But you know he'll always keep moving
		Dm7                       Am7
		You know he's never gonna stop moving
		      C            G                D
		Cause he's rollin, He's the rolling stone
		Dm7                         Am7
		And when you wake up it's a new morning
		Dm7                       Am7
		The sun is shining it's a new morning
		    C             G            A
		And you're going, you're going home
