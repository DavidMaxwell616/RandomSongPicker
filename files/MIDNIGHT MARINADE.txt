MIDNIGHT MARINADE

A6                  Dmaj7        
In days of old when kind bud was sold 
     A6                       Dmaj7        
at a price much cheaper than today. 
     A6                       Dmaj7        
I'd roll a fat cone of Indica homegrown 
     A6                    Dmaj7        
and float across the Milky Way

Bm7 E7

There once was a time when I was so confined
I could not be free. 
But now I'm over like Grover the Casanova 
Rest easy, mama. Whiskey? Gimme!

I'm going crabbing and not for pubic lice
I'm going crabbing and not with gorgonzola slice
And when I'm busy hammerin' Mama I don't need no advice

Whiskey marination sautee and simmer my brain
amidst drunken contemplation. Hmm, every organ complains
while the dry ones weep in misery, 
I ride the bourbon astral plane

Some like deviled crabcakes and belching golden Coors
I live soaked in vomit stuck to gobby sumpump floors
I pride myself in abstaining from Vodka Absolut and Dewars

I know these waters like the back 
of Teddy Pendergrass's legs 
Jackie Gleason's condoms don't hold water
except for Larry Fishboin's scoured skull

Reality's meant for warpers, 
not the meekly squeamish or straight at heart. 
We the corkscrews, pretzels and hairpins 
skoff at your meager lives. 

No room at the finish line 
for groping for the keys. 
Avert your eyes wretched landlubbers 
Mighty Max will 
puke Seven and Seven Seas.
