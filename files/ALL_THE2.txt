Ok, here we go. This is my first post, so deep breaths. This is quite
tricky to play in parts. It's based on the 'David Live' version - as
I don't have a copy of Mott the Hopple! Have fun. Comments corrections
etc, mail me.

	All the Young Dudes
			David Bowie

A	    D			  	A/C#
Well, Billy rapped all night about his suicide
	 Bm				 D/A
How he'd kick it in the head when he was twenty five,
F#m				  A	
speed ive, don't wanna stay alive when your twenty five.
    D				  A/C#
And Wendy's stealing clothes from unlocked cars, and
Bm			D/A			       F#m
Freddies got spots from rippin' off the stars from his face
	      A
(funky little boat race)
    Em					F#7		   Bm
The television man is crazy saying were juvenile deliquent wrecks
   G		D	   A(sus4) A
Oh man I need TV when I got T.Rex - 
	A
Oh brother you guessed, I'm a dude dad.

Chorus
D  A/C#		      Bm7
Ah all the young dudes
D/A		  Am
carry the news
G		  F
boogaloo dudes
C/E		  Bm C A/C# D

A/C#			 Bm7
All the young dudes
D/A		  Am

G		  F
boogaloo dudes
C/E		  Bm C A/C#
carry the news

Lucy looking sweet 'cos he dresses like a queen,

but he can kick like mule it's a real mean team,

but we can love - oh yes we can love.

And my brothers back at home with his Beatles and his Stones,

we never got it off on all that revolution stuff

what a drag, - too many snags.

Now I drunk a lot of wine and I'm feeling fine -

got to race some cat to bed - oh is there concrete all around

or is it it my head - Yeah I'm a dude dad.

repeat chorus.
