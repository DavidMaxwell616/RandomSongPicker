                     It Was A Very Good Year


             Em                 F
When I was seventeen it was a very good year,
           Em   
It was a very good year 
      G                    F
for small town girls and soft summer nights.
      E
We'd hide from the lights
         D                         E
on the village green when I was seventeen.


              Em                 F
When I was twenty-one, it was a very good year,
           Em
it was a very good year
      G              F
for city girls who lived up the stair,
         E
with perfumed hair 
       D                           E
that came undone, when I was twenty-one.


               Em                 F
When I was thirty-five it was a very good year,
          Em
it was a very good year
     G                      F
for blue blooded girls of independant means.
       E
We'd ride in limousines
            D                                 E
their chauffeurs would drive when I was thirty-five.



               Em                        F
But now the days are short, I'm in the autumn of the year,
           Em
and now I think of my life
       G                  F
as vintage wine from the old kegs, 
           E
from the brim to the dregs
              D                      E
it poured sweet and clear; it was a very good year!
