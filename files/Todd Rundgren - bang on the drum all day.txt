Bang The Drum All Day

D       C       G
I don't want to work
  C       D                C   G
I want to bang on the drum all day
I don't want to play
I just want to bang on the drum all day

A
Ever since I was a tiny boy
  Bm
I don't want no candy, I don't need no toy
A
I took a stick and an old coffee can
  E                             G
I bang on that thing 'til I got blisters on my hand because

(chorus)

When I get older they think I'm a fool
The teacher told me I should stay after school
She caught me pounding on the desk with my hands
But my licks was so hot I made the teacher wanna dance

And that's why...

(chorus)

Listen to this:

Every day when I get home from work
I feel so frustrated, the boss is a jerk
And I get my sticks and go out to the shed
And I pound on that drum like it was the boss's head

Because...

(chorus)

I can bang that drum
Hey, you wanna take a bang at it?
I can do this all day
