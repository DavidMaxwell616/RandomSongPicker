INTRO: (E G A G E, E D5 E)2X

E         Esus      E       A G E       Esus        A G E 
Coming to me in the morning     leaving me at night
E         Esus      E      A G E       Esus      A G E 
Coming to me in the morning    leaving me alone
                C            B
You've got that rainbow feel but the rainbow has a beard

E G A G E, E D5 E

E         Esus      E     A G E       Esus          A G E 
Runnin' to me a-cryin'        when he throws you out
E         Esus      E     A G E       Esus      A G E 
Runnin' to me a-cryin         on your own again
                C
You've got that pure feel such good responses
B
But the picture has a mustache

BRIDGE:
       C#                                          E7#9
You're coming to me with that soulful look on your face
       C      F       C        F     C    F        C     B    
You're coming lookin' like you never ever done one wrong thing

SOLO

BRIDGE AGAIN

E         Esus      E     A G E       Esus          A G E 
Many fantastic colors         I feel in a wonderland
E         Esus      E     A G E       Esus          A G E 
Many fantastic colors         makes me feel so good
                C      
You've got that pure feel such good responses
                            B 
You've got that rainbow feel but the rainbow has a beard
