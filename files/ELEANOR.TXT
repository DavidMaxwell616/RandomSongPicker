Lyrics:
C                            Em 
Ahh, look at all the lonely people
C                            Em  
Ahh, look at all the lonely people

Em
Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
C          Em
Lives in a dream
Em                                                                  C 
Waits at the window wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
C         Em
Who is it for

Em             Em6          C/E               Em  
All the lonely people where do they all come from?
Em             Em6          C/E           Em  
All the lonely people where do they all belong?

Em                                 
Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
C            Em
No one comes near
Em                                                                     C  
Look at him working darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
C            Em
what does he care?

(chorus)

Em
Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
C      Em   
Nobody came
Em                                                                  C
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
C           Em
No one was saved

(chorus)
