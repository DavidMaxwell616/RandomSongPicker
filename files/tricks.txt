Tricks of the Tirade - words by Erich

      Dm  Dm/C   G                  A
Lash night     until it bleeds the pink 
           Dm   F            C     A
of coming dawn,   of coming down.
	Dm Dm/C    F	     A
Lash night     I god gooden drunk,
       C	  E             A
and I god gooden drunk tonight too.


C           G#
Up on good booze
    F                    G#
I flash my flask to the moon and howl,
C           G#    D7                Fm
I lash the night with my lightning strike
         Dm        Dm/C   A/C#
and the whip of a silver tongue,


Dm        Dm/C      G           A
I am brave,    and once quite young,
    Dm         F       C               A
and not afraid   of a damaged liver & lungs
   Dm          Dm/C    
a purple sag below my eye, 
         F	        A
or the chance I wont remember why
 C	  E             A
all the lashing I have done.

C           G#
With every swig
    F             G#
I lay on more incoherent licks 
C           G#         D7           Fm
until the night is so red from the fight 
Dm        Dm/C   A/C#
that it becomes morning.

(first verse)

C     G#
Every sip
 F                 G#
sends me over the lip 
C           G#       D7           Fm
until everything is not moving anymore 
     Dm     Dm/C    A/C#
And then I begin to snore.
      Dm
Lash Night
