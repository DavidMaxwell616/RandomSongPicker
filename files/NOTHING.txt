NOTHING

F#                                 
I met a girl, she was half my height, she said 
C7                             
"You're gonna be mine tonight, 
F#
but it's only fair if I tell you right now, 
C7
you make no difference anyhow.

You mean nothing to me, I mean I see you like a dog sees a flea."

So she took me right home and she sat me down and said,
"I'm gonna turn your world around."
I said "Lady what're you tryin' to prove, 
you can't tame my stone groove.
Don't call me nothing again. You don't got what it takes to win."

Just then I noticed my wallet was missin' and I screamed,
"Lady you better listen..I got five knuckles, gonna lay you still, 
then we'll see who's nothing, yes we will."

And then a man entered and he was so big 
he made Iron Mike Tyson look like a twig. 
So I swallowed my pride and away I run. 
Away I run to get my shotgun.
And she'll be nothing no more, and I'll be headed
for the liquor store.
Nothing no more, and I'll be headed for the liquor store
