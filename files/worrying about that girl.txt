G
Met a girl, fell in love, glad as I can be
C
Met a girl, fell in love, glad as I can be
D                         C    
But I think all the time, is she true to me?
                 F               D7              C7                  G     
'Cause there's nothing in this world to stop me worryin' 'bout that girl

I found out I was wrong, she was just two timing
I found out I was wrong, she just kept on lying
Now she tries to tell the truth, and I just can't believe
'Cause there's nothing in this world to stop me worryin' 'bout that girl

Tell me who can I turn to, just who can I believe?
Tried to put her out of my mind, she'll only cause me grief
I love that girl, whatever she's done, you know it hurts me deeply
'Cause there's nothing in this world to stop me worryin' 'bout that girl

I know she's been with other fellas, why does she keep on lying?
It hurts me so when she says nothing, I really feel like dying
I ache inside until I think[?], I know it's just my pride
'Cause there's nothing in this world to stop me worryin' 'bout that girl
'Cause there's nothing in this world to stop me worryin' 'bout that girl
