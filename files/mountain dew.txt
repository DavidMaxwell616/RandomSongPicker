MOUNTAIN DEW 
(Arr. & adapted by P./T.& W. Clancy/T. Makem)
guitar capoed up 2 frets
          C                F
Where the grasses grow and waters flow
     C             G
In a free and easy way.
    C                     F
But give me enough of the rare old stuff
       C         G      C   
That's made near Galway Bay.
    C
And policemen all from Donegal.
                  Am
Sligo and Leitrim too,
      C                      F   
We'll give them the slip and we'll take a sip
       C        G        C 
Of the real old Mountain Dew

Hi the dithery idle loo, ditheri oodle idle loo
Dithery oo di dithery i day
Hi the dithery idle loo, ditheri oodle idle loo
Dithery oo di dithery i day

At the top of the hill there's a neat little still,
Where the smoke curls up in the sky;
By the smoke and the smell you can plainly tell
That there's poteen brewing nearby;
It fills the air with an odor rare
And between both me and you,
When home we roll we'll take a bowl
Or a bucket of the Mountain Dew.

Now learned men who use the pen
They sing your praises high
That sweet poteen from Ireland green
Distilled from wheat and rye;
Throw away your pills, it will cure all ills
Pagan or Christian or Jew
Take off your coat and grease your throat
With the real old Mountain Dew
