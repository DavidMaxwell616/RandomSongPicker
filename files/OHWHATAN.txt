Oh, what a night, late December back in '63
What a very special time for me
As I remember what a night!

Oh what a night,
You know I didn't even know her name
But I was never gonna be the same
What a lady, what a night!

Oh, I got a funny feeling when she walked in the room
And I, as I recall it ended much too soon

Oh what a night,
Hypnotizing, mesmerizing me
She was everything I dreamed she'd be
Sweet surrender, what a night!

I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder
Straining my head around and taking my body under

(Oh what a night!)

Oh, I got a funny feeling when she walked in the room
And I, as I recall it ended much too soon


Oh what a night,
Why'd it take so long to see the light?
Seemed so wrong, but now it seems so right
What a lady, what a night!

I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder
Straining my head around and taking my body under

(Oh what a night!)

I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder
Straining my head around and taking my body under
