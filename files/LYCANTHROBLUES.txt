F#
(I drink so much bourbon it makes me howl at the moon)2X
Bm                      D/F#
And when I get my fill, baby you'll find out soon

(Ain't no Lon Chaney, make Michael Landon shine my shoes)2X
Forget about David Naughton and Warren Zevon, 
they will sink into obscurity's blues

(I drink silver bullets, and I don't use no ice)2X
I don't want your whole liver, I just want a doggone slice

(I crave long pigmeat mama, like I crave jellyroll)2X
I won't call you vampire, just don't call me cannibal

(Bourbon makes me skiddish, makes me growl and think of death)2X
Every educated fool already knows that bourbon is breath

(You know Catherine Martin is a lowdown dirty thing)2X
If it doesn't rub the lotion on itself, it will get the hose again

(You know Clarice ain't no lowdown dirty gal)2X
For tasty flesh like hers I would suck 
the president's brains out with a straw
