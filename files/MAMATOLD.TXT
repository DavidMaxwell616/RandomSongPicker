MAMA TOLD ME NOT TO COME 
Randy Newman

Have whiskey with your water, sugar with your tea
What are all these crazy questions that you're asking of me
This is the wildest party that I ever did see
So don't turn on the light 'cause I don't wanna see

Mama told me not to come
Mama told me not to come
Mama said that ain't no way to have fun

Open up the window let some air into this room
I think I'm almost choking on the smell of stale perfume
That cigarette you're smoking bout to scare me half to death
Open up the window let me catch my breath

The radio is blasting someone's beating on the door
Our hostess is not lasting she's out on the floor
I seen so many things that I ain't never seen before
I don't know what it is but I don't wanna see no more
