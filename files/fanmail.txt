Howdy Maxx,

Thanks for providing such comprehensive and accurate tabs.  I've been learning a lot from you from this site.  Currently working on Jesu and Bouree and the Stones song from your efforts.  Have you ever considered tabbing Mason Williams "Classical Gas"?  It has a real nice melody and I remember it from the Glen Campbell show in the 70's.  My guitar instructor has been playing parts of it but its not there yet.

Thanks again.
Regards,
Rob Trautwein
