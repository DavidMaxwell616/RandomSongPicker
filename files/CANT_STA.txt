If anybody's not familiar with the notations, he're the structure of the song:
Play first verse until the ":||", that means go to the "||:", and
play second verse (lyrics not included but starts with "see you've sent
my letters back..", but skip the "* first verse only" section and go directly
to "second verse and &". Play til you see "D. & al Coda" meaning go back to
the "&" sign, this would be "guess you'd call it suicide.." in the song, again
skip the "* first verse only" and go directly to "second verse and &" but this
time go to "Coda" at the measure annotated with "To Coda". Each measure is
by the way indicated by the "|" signs. Good luck, Ameen.
