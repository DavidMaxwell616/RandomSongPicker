   I'm posting this because I haven't seen it before here.
   David Bowie's _Rebel Rebel_:

Hmm... didn't look much like what I play, so here is my version
(which, of course, is not necesarrily worse better or anything else
:^)

Main riff:

---0-0-0-0-0------------
--/5-3-2-0-0---2-0------
-------------------1----
0--------------------2--
------------------------
-------------0----------

Chorus:
A D B E (bar chords, 5th, 5th, 7th, 7th frets).

Sometimes when going from chords to riffs, you play a G on the low E
string and bend up a half step or so.

Enjoy,

(Hot tramp, I love you so {on single and live versions})
Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo

*verse 1*
Got your mother in a whirl (2nd time: 'cause)
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey, babe, your hairs alright
Hey, babe, lets go out tonight
You like me, and I like it all
We like dancing, and we look divine
You love bands when they play it hard
You want more, and you want it first
Put you down, say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on

*chorus*
Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel Rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel Rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so!

Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo

*repeat verse 1*

*chorus*

Don't ya?
Ow
Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo

*chorus* (except ends : I love you so much!)

You've torn your dress, your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got transmission and a live wire
Got your cue lines and a handful of ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dues
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
To what you wanna know
Calamitys child, chi-chile, chi-chile
Where'd you wanna go?
Can I do for you? Looks like you've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know?
How could they know? Hah
Hah-hah
