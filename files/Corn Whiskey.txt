CORN WHISKEY

Dm Gm C Em Dm

Well, I've been a moonshiner now these 17 long years,
Spent all my money on whiskey and beer,
Now I'll go to some holler and set up my still,
And I'll sell you a gallon for a $2 bill.

Chorus:
Corn whiskey, corn whiskey, I like you pretty well.
You've killed all my kinfolks and sent them to hell.
You sent all my kinfolks on rot gut and rye,
And I guess you'll send me when I'm ready to die.

I'll go to some grocery and drink with my friends,
Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.
God bless those pretty women, how I wish they were mine.
Their breath tastes as sweet as the good old moonshine.

Chorus

Well, it's red meat when I'm hungry and moonshine when I'm dry,
Greenback when I'm hard up and religion when I die.
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram.
When the bottle gets empty, it ain't worth one damn.

Chorus
