Time (demo version)
Roger Waters

E                                        G7          
Ticking away, the moments that make up a dull day
D                                        E
You fritter away the days in an offhand way
                                             G7           
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
D                                                   E
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way.

C                                G
Lying supine in the sunshine, let the grass grow in your brain,
C                                     G
You are young, and life is long, and there is time to kill today,
C                           B
And then one day you find, ten years have got behind you
A                             D                              E
No one told you where to run, you missed the starting gun.


And you run, and you run to catch up to the sun, but it's sinking,
And racing around, to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but your older,
Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death.

Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught, or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quite desperation is the english way, 
The time is gone, the song is over thought I'd something more to say.
