BEDSPINS

Dm       Am                E
I shot myself full of idle truths 
Dm              Am                E
went staggering down through the world. 
Dm     Am            E      
Til I came across an idol
F               G               A
I hurled all my epithets and concussions.
G     F                    A
Now I can't even hate the Russians. 

Where will I go when truth changes by tomorrow. 
Seek the truth and you only seek a lie. 
Firm as a rock today will be faded away 
sooner or later if it's here to stay. 
Cause nothing stays even tomorrow fades away.

Bridge:
Bm                         G                 F     
What should I do when I'm looking through a lens. 
Bm                          G              Am
I realize distortion but of course I look again.
E            C#m           A               E
Reality is a broken glass alternatives my friends.
F#m              D                 F
Protect me from normality and I'll follow you 
         G      A
to the grizzly end. 

Freud would say "I'm psyched to see you two together 
especially after all that LSD'Angelo."
But he's a fool, doesn't wipe his drool 
      F                G   F   A
as it collects on your window pane. 

His fifty minute hour is winding down. 
The laughing gas chamber wedding is soon. 
He took time and a half to course through your brain
F                   G
So shave his beard, kick him out of here. 
     F             G        A
His drool on your stool is sticking
