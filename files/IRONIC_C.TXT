intro
picked version of the verses

   F#  B   F#            G#m
an old man turned ninety-eight
           F#   B      F#            G#m
he won the lottery and died the next day
       F#    B           F#    G#m
it's a black fly in your chardonnay
       F#        B          F#         G#m
it's a death row pardon two minutes to late

          F#   B              F#    G#m
isn't it ironic... don't you think

                     F# B         F#      G#m
<<chorus>> it's like rain on your wedding day
                       F# B             F#      G#m
           it's a free ride when you've already paid
                         F#   B          F#          G#m
           it's the good advice that you just didn't take
           A              G#m           F#
           who would have thought... it figures

mr. play-it-safe was afraid to fly
he packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye
he waited his whole damn life just to take that flight
and as the plane crashed down he thouht "well isn't this nice..."

             F#    B             F#     G#m
and isn't it ironic... don't you think?

<<repeat chorus>>

     B                                F#
well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
                                      G#m
when you think everything is okay and everything's going right
     B                               F#
and life has a funny way of helping you out when
                                      G#m
you think everything's gone wrong and everything blows up in your face


a traffic jam when you are already late
a no-smoking sign on your cigarette break
it's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
it's like meeting the man of my dreams then meeting his beautiful wife

             F#     B            F#      G#m
and isn't it ironic... don't you think?
             F#     B             F#              G#m
a little too ironic... and yeah i really do think...

<<repeat chorus>>

 B                                     F#
life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
 B                         F#                B
life has a funny, funny way  of helping you out -- helping you out
