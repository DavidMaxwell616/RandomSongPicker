Well I'm looking through Harlem, my stomach squeals just a little more. 
     G                 C/E                           F        F#      G
The stagecoach full of feathers and footprints rolls up to my soapbox door.

breathes in my face bourbon and coke possessed words, 
           G            B/F#     Em       Em/D   C       F   G
"Haven't I seen you somewhere in hell, or was it just an accident?" 

(play first two measures of intro and say)
"You know how I felt then"

Before I could ask if it was the east or the west side 
my feet they howled in pain. The wheels of a bandwagon 
cut very deep but not as deep in my mind as the rain and 
as they pulled away I could see her words staggering falling
on my muddy tent. Well I picked them up and brushed them off 
to see what they said - you wouldn't believe it. "Come around 
to my room with the tooth in the middle and bring along a 
bottle and a president."

Chorus
    B/F#                                  Em   Em/D      C     
And sometimes it's not so easy 'specially when your only friend 
G      B/F#            Em        Em/D      C           F       G 
talks, sees, looks and feels like you. You do just the same as him.

(play intro and say)
"It gets very lonely out here in this room baby"


Well I'm riding through L.A. on a bicycle built for fools.
And I see one of my old buddies and he says "You don't 
look the way you used to do." And I say "Some people look
like a coin box." He says, "You look like you don't have 
any coins to spare And I lay back and thought to myself 
And I said this as I picked up my pride from beneath the
pay phone and combed his breath right out of my hair.

>Chorus

I just got out of a Scandinavian jail and I'm on my
way straight back to you but I feel so dizzy I take
a quick look in the mirror to make sure my friends here
with me. And you know good well I don't drink coffee
so you fill my cup with sand and the frozen TV's on the
barroom sharing it's sticks around the broken edge and
my coat that you let your dog by the fire on. And your
cat he attacks me from his pill box ledge and I thought
you were my friend too man my shadow comes around before
you.

>Chorus
