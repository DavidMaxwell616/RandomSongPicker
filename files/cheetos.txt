Tears In Heaven (Eric Clapton)

Verse:
 A       E/G#    F#m     D/F#  A          E7     
I can smell Cheetos when I look out the window
 A       E/G#    F#m  D/F#   A         E7     
I have to hold my nose when I look out the window
 F#m        C#/F   A7       F#7   
The smell is strong  kinda smells like John
       Bm              Esus          A 
and I know I'll never eat Cheetos again

I can hardly breathe, if I look out my window
Could somebody please, please close that damn window
I need to find a hose or keep my window closed
and I know I'll never eat Cheetos again


Bridge:
 C       G/B      Am               D/F#         G   D  Em   D G 
You better hold your breath or catch the stench of death
 C       G/B      Am                D/D#       G       D    E    
Tears will run like rain  Have you beggin  please beggin please

Beyond the door, there's peace for sure
