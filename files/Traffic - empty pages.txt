D/A   E6/A   C/A   D   D

Verse:
E9           A 
Found someone who can comfort me

    D/E       A         E
But there are always exceptions

E9            A         E
And she's good at appearing sane

D/E        A                E     D/A
But I just want you to know

Verse:
She's the one makes me feel so good
When everything is against me
Picks me up when I'm feeling down
So I've got something to show

Chorus:
              E6/A      C/A                   D
Staring at empty pages, since you're gone the same old plot

D/A                         C/A             D
     Staring at empty pages,     going along the ages

Verse:
Often lost and forgotten, the vagueness and the mirth
I've been thinking I'm working too hard, but I've got something to show

(repeat 1st verse)

Chorus
