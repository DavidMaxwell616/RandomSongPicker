Verse 1:

	E         D               E      D
	Up every morning just to keep a job
	         E        D               E        D
	I gotta fight my way through the hustlin' mob
	 E             D            E      D
	Sounds of the city poundin' in my brain
	       E           D             E
	While another day goes down the drain

Chorus 1:

	            A            D              A       D
	But it's a five o'clock world when the whistle blows
	A             D           A     D
	Noone owns a piece of my time
	               A           D     A        D
	And there's a five o'clock me inside my clothes
	A                              B
	Thinkin' that the world looks fine, yeah

	E   D     E    D    E    D    E    D
	Adaladee-hee, hee, yeah

Verse 2:

	Tradin' my time for the pay I get
	Livin' on money that I ain't made yet
	Gotta keep goin', gotta make my way
	But I live for the end of the day

Chorus 2:

	But it's a five o'clock world when the whistle blows
	Noone owns a piece of my time
	And there's a long-haired girl who waits, I know
	To ease my troubled mind, yeah

	Adaladee-hee, hee, yeah

Verse 3:

	In the shelter of her arms everythings OK
	She talks and the world goes slippin' away (it slips away)
	And I know the reason I can still go on
	When every other is gone

Chorus 3:

	In my five o'clock world she waits for me
	Nothing else matters at all
	'Cause every time my baby smiles at me
	I know that its all worthwhile, yeah

Coda: [repeat to fade]

	E   D     E    D    E    D    E    D
	Adaladee-hee, hee, yeah
