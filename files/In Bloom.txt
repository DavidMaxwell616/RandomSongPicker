|-3---3-3-3-5------3---3-3-3-6--------|
|-1---1-1-1-5-ring-3---3-3-3-6-ring---|

This comes after the intro riff, but is also played during the verse to.
Play it as shown here after the intro, but during the verse, either mute
it, or tweak the upper part of chords.

Then go back to the intro riff.

Here's the solo. It's alot different than the ones I've seen posted, bu
what do you expect for free from the Internet? :)

Use a lot of distortion if you haven't already

In Bloom This is the mane riff played
======== throughout the intro. The
chorus is a bit different, 
---------------------------------------- but I think it uses the same
---------------------------------------- chords. There is no guitar
---------------------------------------- during the verses, only bass.
