Sing This All Together

Why don't we sing this song all together?
Open our heads let the pictures come
And if we close all our eyes together
Then we will see where we all come from

Pictures of us through the steamy haze
Pictures of us painted in our caves

Why don't we sing this song all together?
Open our heads let the pictures come
And if we close all our eyes together
Then we will see where we all come from

Why don't we sing this song all together?
Open our heads let the pictures come
And if we close all our eyes together
Then we will see where we all come from

Pictures of us beating on our drum
Never stopping till the rain has come

Why don't we sing this song all together?
Open our heads let the pictures come
And if we close all our eyes together
Then we will see where we all come from

Citadel

Men at arms shout "Who goes there?"
We have journeyed far from here
Armed with bibles make us swear
Candy and Cathy hope you both are well
Please come see me in the citadel

Flags are flying dollar bills
From the heights of concrete hills
You can't see the pinnacles
Candy and Cathy hope you both are well
Please come see me in the citadel

In the streets of many walls
Here the peasants come and crawl
You can hear their numbers called
Candy and Cathy hope you both are well
Please come see me in the citadel

Screaming people fly so fast
In their shiny metal cars
Through the woods of steel and glass
Candy and Cathy hope you both are well
Please come see me in your citadel

Oh well.

In Another Land

In another land
where the breeze and the trees
And the flowers were blue
I stood and held your hand
And the grass grew high
And the feathers floated by
I stood and held your hand
And nobody else's hand will ever do
Nobody else will do
And I awoke;
Was this some kind of joke?
Much to my surprise
When I opened my eyes

We walked across the sand
and the sea and the sky
And the castles were blue
I stood and held your hand
and the spray flew high
And the feathers floated by
I stood and held your hand
And nobody else's hand will ever do
Nobody else will do
And I awoke
was this some kind of joke
Much to my surprise
When I opened my eyes

We heard the trumpets blow
and the  sky turned grey
When I accidentally said
That I didn't know
how I came to be here
When I'm fast asleep in bed
I stood and held your hand
And nobody else's hand will ever do
Nobody else's hand
Then I awoke
was this some kind of joke
I opened my eyes
Much to my surprise

2000 Man

Well, my name is a number, a piece of plastic film
And I grow tiny flowers in my little window sill
Don't you know I'm the two thousand man?
And my kids they just don't understand me at all

Though my wife still respects me, I really misuse here
I am having an affair with a random computer
Don't you know I'm the two thousand man?
And my kids they just don't understand me at all

Oh, daddy, be proud of your planet
Oh, mummy, be proud of your sun
Oh, daddy, be proud of your planet
Oh, mummy, be proud of your sun

Oh, daddy is your brain still flashing
Like it did when you were young?
Or did you come down crashing
Seeing all the things you done?

Oh it's a big put on!
Oh, daddy, be proud of your planet
Oh, mummy, be proud of your sun

Oh, daddy, be proud of your planet
Oh, mummy, be proud of your sun

Oh, daddy, be proud of your planet
Oh, mummy, be proud of your sun

Oh, daddy, be proud of your planet
Oh, mummy, be proud of your sun

And you know who's the two thousand man
And your kids they just won't understand you at all

Sing This All Together (see what happens)

(crowd of people talking)

Where's that joint?
All right, thank you.

Why don't we sing this song all together?
Open our minds let the pictures come
And if we close all our eyes together
Then we will see where we all come from

Pictures of us spin the circling sun
Pictures of us show that we're all one

She's a Rainbow

She comes in colors everywhere
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Combing colors in the air
Oh, everywhere,
She comes in colors

She comes in colors everywhere
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Combing colors in the air
Oh, everywhere,
She comes in colors

Have you seen her dressed in blue?
See the sky in front of you
And her face is like a sail
Speck of white so fair and pale
Have you seen a lady fairer?
She comes in colors everywhere
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Combing colors in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colors

Have you seen her all in gold?
Like a queen in days of old
She shoots colors all around
Like a sunset going down
Have you seen a lady fairer?
She comes in colors everywhere
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Combing colors in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colors

She's like a rainbow
Combing colors in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colors

The Lantern

We in our present life
knew that the stars were right
that if you are the first to go
You'll leave a sign to let me know
tell me so
Please, carry the lantern light

You cross the sea of night
Free from the spell of fright
Your cloak it is a spirit shroud
you wake me in my sleeping hours
Like a cloud
so please, carry the lantern high

Me, in my sorry plight
You waiting every night
My face, it turns a deathly pale
You're talking to me through your veil
I hear you wail
so please, carry the lantern light

The servants sleep
the doors are barred
You hear the stopping of my heart
we never part   [ "it never parts"? ]
so please, carry the lantern high

Gomper

By the lake with lily flowers
While away the evening hours

To and fro she's gently gliding
On the glassy lake she's riding

She swims to the side
The sun sees her dried
The birds hover high
I stifle a cry

The birds hover high
She moans with a sigh

2000 Light Years from Home

Sun turning 'round with graceful motion
We're setting off with soft explosion
Bound for a start with fiery oceans
It's so very lonely
You're a hundred light years from home.

Freezing red deserts turn to dark
Energy here in every part
It's so very lonely
You're six hundred light years from home

It's so very lonely
You're a thousand light years from home

It's so very lonely
You're a thousand light years from home

Bell flight fourteen you now can land
See you on AldeBaran
Safe on the green desert sand
It's so very lonely
You're two thousand light years from home

It's so very lonely
You're two thousand light years from home

On With the Show

Good evening one and all
We're all so glad to see you here
We'll play your favorite songs
while you all soak up the atmosphere
We'll start with Old Man River
Then maybe Stormy Weather too
I'm sure you know just what to do
On with the show good health to you

Please pour another glass
It's time to watch the cabaret
Your wife will never know
That you're not really working late
Your hostess here is Wendy
You'll find her very friendly, too
And we don't care just what you do
On with the show, good health to you

[crowd/party noise]
But Nina'll start the show [in t????????]
[crowd/party noise]

Oh if by chance you find
That you can't make it anymore
We'll put you in a cab
And get you safely to the door
Oh, we've got all the answers
And we've got lovely dancers, too
There's nothing else you have to do
On with the show, good health to you

You're all such lovely people
Dancing gaily round the floor
But if you have to fight, please
Take your trouble out the door
And now I say with sorrow
Until this time tomorrow, oh
We'll bid you all a fond adieu
On with the show, good health to you
