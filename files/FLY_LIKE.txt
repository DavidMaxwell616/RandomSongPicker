Fly Like an Eagle
Steve Miller Band
Transcribed by Adam Lane
This is a pretty crappy transcription.  The chords for the chorus are
pretty good. I think the intro is right too, but there's really no guitar
to speak of during the verse, so that part is how Mr. Miller played it on
Don Kershner's rock concert in the 70's which I saw on VH1 a few weeks ago. 
Hope it gives you some idea.  And if you have anything better or any other
Steve Miller tunes, please post them.

Intro: I think this plays twice
e---------------------------------------------e
B---------------------------------------------B
G---------5-5--------7-5--------5-5--------5--G
D-------7-5-5--------7-5------7-5-5--------5--D
A---7h9--------7h9h7------7h9--------7h9p7----A
E---------------------------------------------E

Like I said, I don't think this is on the album version.  I tried to show

the rythm, but it didn't work, so just play with these notes or something

Verse:(Time keeps on slippin'...)
e------------------------------------------e
B--------------------------------------1---B
G---2---2-0--2-2-2-0---2---0---2---0h2-----G
D------------------------------------------D
A------------------------------------------A
E------------------------------------------E
   time...on slippin           into the future

Now the easy part, even though this is organ, these are the chords.
Chorus
        Am          D    F       Am
I wanna fly like an eagle to the see
        Am          D            F            Am
I wanna fly like an eagle let my spirit carry me

hopefully you can do something with this crappy tab. And like I said,
if you have any more Steve Miller or a correction of this, please post
it.
