All the time
I'm finding ways to make things fall in line
I know how tricky things can be.
But I really do believe that

You are mine
And all the stars are there before us
Listen here some things are meant to be

Try to take it slow
Try to loose control
But I'll tell you what the trick is
What you get is what you had to give away
When I learned I found my eyes were opened

Long ago, I had a dream
That quickly faded
Goes to show how tricky dreams can be
But wouldn't you agree that

Those who know
Will whisper when they see us
Walking, "There's a love that's always meant to be."
