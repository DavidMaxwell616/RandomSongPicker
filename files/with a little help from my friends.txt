WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS- The Beatles

 E             B         F#m
What would you do if I sang out of tune
                        B7          E
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
              B              F#m
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
                     B7          E
And I'll try not to sing out of key 

CHORUS:
          D                  A             E
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
           D                  A             E
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends
            D                A              E    
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends

 E         B           F#m                              B7     E
What do I do when my love is away (Does it worry you to be alone?)
          B           F#m
How do I feel by the end of the day 
                       B7            E
(Are you sad because you're on your own?)

No...CHORUS

BRIDGE:
E        C#m       F#m7    E      D        A
(Do you need anybody?) I need somebody to love
          C#m    F#m7     E       D        A
(Could it be anybody?) I want somebody to love 

Would you believe in a love at first sight
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light
I can't tell you but I know it's mine ...CHORUS

BRIDGE #2:
(Do you need anybody?) I just need somebody to love
(Could it be anybody?) I want somebody to love

A          D                A                E

               D                  A             E
Mm, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends
            D                 A             E
Oh I get high with a little help from my friends
            D                                A
Yes, I get by with a little help from my friends
