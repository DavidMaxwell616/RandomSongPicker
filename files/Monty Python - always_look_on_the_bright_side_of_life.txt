     G                 Ebdim          G6              Cmaj7
Some things in life are bad they can   really make you mad
      Am7                  D7sus D7   G6
Other things just make you swear and curse
            C6                 Cm6
When you've chewing an life's gristle
      G              E
Don't grumble give a whistle
    Am7                                   D7
And this'll help things turn out for the best

    G      Em          Am7     D7      G      Em    Am7    D7
And always look on the bright side of life
   G   Em          Am7    D7      G     Em    Am7    D7
Always look on the light side of life

    C6               Cm6              G                Em
If life seems jolly rotten there's something you've forgotten
              Am7                  D7        G
and that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing.
            C6             Cm6             G     Em
When you've feeling in the dumps don't be silly chumps
     Am7                                       D7
Just purse your lips and whistle - that's the thing

    G      Em          Am7     D7      G      Em    Am7    D7
And always look on the bright side of life
           G   Em          Am7    D7        G     Em    Am7    D7
Come on always look on the bright side of life

     C6             Cm6        G               Em
For life is quite absurd and death's the final word
         Am7              D7             G
you must always face the curtain with a bow
 C6               Cm6             G          Em
Forget about your sin - give the audience a grin
  Am7                                D7
Enjoy it - it's your last chance anyhow.
    G      Em          Am7     D7      G      Em    Am7    D7
So always look on the bright side of death
G      Em       Am7           D7    G         Em    Am7    D7
just before you draw your terminal breath

 C6               Cm6    G              Em
Life's a piece if shit when you look at it
Am7                 D                   G
Life's a laugh and death's a joke it's true
       C6             Cm6
You'll see it's all a show
        G               Em
keep'em laughing as you go
       Am7                               D7
just remember that the last laugh is on you

    G      Em          Am7     D7      G     Em    Am7    D7
And always look on the bright side of life
G      Em          Am7    D7      G      Em    Am7    D7
Always look on the right side of life
