We heard this song recently on WXLE in Albany, NY, and it has quickly become their most-requested holiday recording!  The Djs say it came to them in a plain brown wrapper, and hasn¹t yet been released on CD.  We enjoy it so much, and want to share it with friends at our own upcoming Hanukkah party, that we decided to transcribe it....Bruce, Sandy & Ari

The Hanukkah Song  
Adam Sandler (of Saturday Night Live)


Intro:   This is a song, that uh, there¹s alot of Xmas songs out there, but not too many about Hanukkah, so I wrote a song for all those nice little Jewish kids who don¹t get to hear any Hanukkah songs--here we go...

 
A           E         D          E
Put on your yalmulka, here comes Hanukkah
     A       E            D         E   
It¹s so much fun-akkah to celebrate Hanukkah, 

A        E      D           E    
Hanukkah is the Festival of Lights,
A                     E                 Bm    D     E
Instead of one day of presents, we have eight crazy nights.
A                           E                D          E 
When you feel like the only kid in town with out a Xmas tree,
A                E                      D                 E 
Here¹s a list of people who are Jewish, just like you and me:

A         E    D            E  
David Lee Roth lights the menorrah,
A           E                           D          E 
So do James Caan, Kirk Douglas, and the late Dinah Shore-ah

A                E             D         E 
Guess who eats together at the Carnegie Deli,
A           E              D            E   
Bowzer from Sha-na-na, and Arthur Fonzarelli.

Paul Newman¹s half Jewish; Goldie Hawn¹s half too,
Put them together--what a fine lookin¹ Jew!   [Esus]  [E]

D    
You don¹t need ³Deck the Halls² or ³Jingle Bell Rock²

[D] So many Jews are in show biz--
[E] Tom Cruise isn¹t, [tacit] but I heard his agent is.  [Esus]

[A] Tell your friend Ver[E]onica, it¹s [D] time you celebrate [E] Hanukkah
I [A] hope I get a har[E]monica, on this [D] lovely, lovely [E] Hanukkah.
