Sympathy for the Devil

      Please allow me to introduce myself
      I'm a man of wealth and taste
      I've been around for a long, long year
      Stole many a man's soul and faith

      And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
      Had his moment of doubt and pain
      Made damn sure that Pilate
      Washed his hands and sealed his fate

      Pleased to meet you
      Hope you guess my name
      But what's puzzling you
      Is the nature of my game

      I stuck around St. Petersberg
      When I saw it was a time for a change
      Killed the Czar and his ministers
      Anastasia screamed in vain

      I rode a tank
      Held a general's rank
      When the Blitzkrieg raged
      And the bodies stank

      Pleased to meet you
      Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
      What's puzzling you
      Is the nature of my game, oh yeah

      I watched with glee
      While your kings and queens
      Fought for ten decades
      For the Gods they made

      I shouted out
      "Who killed the Kennedys?"
      When after all
      It was you and me

      Let me please introduce myself
      I'm a man of wealth and taste
      And I laid traps for troubadors
      Who get killed before they reached Bombay

      Pleased to meet you
      Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
      But what's puzzling you
      Is the nature of my game, oh yeah, get down, baby

      Pleased to meet you
      Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
      But what's confusing you
      Is just the nature of my game

      Just as every cop is a criminal
      And all the sinners Saints
      As heads is tails
      Just call me Lucifer
      'Cause I'm in need of some restraint

      So if you meet me
      Have some courtesy
      Have some sympathy, and some taste
      Use all your well-learned politesse
      Or I'll lay your soul to waste, um yeah

      Pleased to meet you
      Hope you guessed my name, um yeah
      But what's puzzling you
      Is the nature of my game, um baby, get down

      Woo, who
      Oh yeah, get on down
      Oh yeah
      Oh yeah!

      Tell me baby, what's my name
      Tell me honey, baby guess my name
      Tell me baby, what's my name
      I tell you one time, you're to blame

      Ooo, who
      Ooo, who
      Ooo, who
      Ooo, who, who
      Ooo, who, who
      Ooo, who, who
      Ooo, who, who
      Oh, yeah

      What's me name
      Tell me, baby, what's my name
      Tell me, sweetie, what's my name

      Ooo, who, who
      Ooo, who, who
      Ooo, who, who
      Ooo, who, who
      Ooo, who, who
      Ooo, who, who
      Ooo, who, who
      Oh, yeah

No Expectations


      Take me to the station
      And put me on a train
      I've got no expectations
      To pass through here again

      Once I was a rich man
      Now I am so poor
      But never in my sweet short life
      Have I felt like this before

      You heart is like a diamond
      You throw your pearls at swine
      And as I watch you leaving me
      You pack my piece of mind

      Our love was like the water
      That splashes on a stone
      our love is like our music
      its here, and then its gone

      So take me to the airport
      And put me on a plane
      I got no expectations
      To pass through here again

Dear Doctor


      Oh help me, please doctor I'm a damaged
      There's a pain where there once was a heart
      It's sleepin, its a beatin'
      Can't ya please tear it out, and preserve it
      Right there in that jar?

      Oh help me please mama, I'm sickning
      Its today that's the day of the plunge
      Oh the gal I'm to marry
      Is a bow-legged sow
      I've been soakin up drink like a sponge

      "Don't ya worry, get dressed", cried my mother
      As she plied me with bourbon so sour
      Pull your socks up, put your suit on
      comb your long hair down,
      for you will be wed in the hour

      So help me, please doctor I'm damaged
      There's a pain where there once was a heart
      I'm, sleepin, its a beatin
      Can't ya please tear it out, and preserve  it
      Right there in that jar?

      There's a pain where there once was a heart
      Its sleepin, its a beatin'
      Can't ya please tear it out, and preserve
      Right there in that jar?

      I was tremblin, as I put on my jacket
      It had creases as sharp as a knife
      I put the ring in my pocket
      But there was a note
      And my heart jumped it jumped into my mouth

      It read, "Darlin', I'm sorry to hurt you.
      But I have no courage to speak to your face.
      But I'm down in Virginia with your cousin Lou
      There be no wedding today."

      So help me, please doctor I'm damaged
      You can put back my heart in its hole
      Oh mamma, I'm cryin
      Tears of relief
      And my pulse is now under control

Jig-Saw Puzzle


      There's a tramp sittin' on my doorstep
      Tryin to waste his time
      with his mentholated sandwich
      He's a walking clothes line
      And here comes the bishops daughter
      On the other side
      She looks a triffle jeolous
      She's been an outcast all her life

       Me, I'm waiting so patiently
       Lying on the floor
       I'm just trying to do my jig-saw puzzle
       Before it rains anymore

      Oh the gangster looks so frightning
      with his luger in his hand
      when he gets home to his children
      he's a family man
      but when it comes to the nitty-gritty
      he can shove in his knife
      Yes he really looks quite religious
      He's been an outlaw all his life

       Me, I'm waiting so patiently
       Lying on the floor
       I'm just trying to do this jig-saw puzzle
       Before it rains anymore

       Me, I'm waiting so patiently
       Lying on the floor
       I'm just trying to do this jig-saw puzzle
       Before it rains anymore

      Oh the singer, he looks angry
      At being thrown to the lions
      And the bass player, he looks nervous
      About the girls outside
      And the drummer, he was shattered
      Trying to keep up time
      And the guitar players look damaged
      They've been outcasts all thier lives

       Me, I'm waiting so patiently
       Lying on the floor
       I'm just trying to do this jig-saw puzzle
       Before it rains anymore

      And as twenty thousand grandma's
      Waving thier hankies in the air
      All burning up their pensions
      And shouting, "It's not fair!"
      There's a regiment of soldiers
      Standing looking on
      And the queen is bravely shouting,
      "What the Hell is going on?"

      With a blood-curdling "tally-ho"
      She charged into the ranks
      And blessed all those grandma's who
      With their dying breaths screamed, "Thanks!"

       Me, I'm waiting so patiently
       With my woman on the floor
       We're just trying to do this jig-saw puzzle
       Before it rains anymore

Street Fighting Man


      Everywhere I hear the sound of marching charging feet, boy
      Cause summer's here, and the time is right
      For fighting in the street, boy

       But what can a poor boy do
       except to sing for a rock and roll band
       'cause in sleepy London town
       There's just no place for a street fighting man! No!

      Hey! think the time is right for a palace revolution
      But where I live the game to play
      Is compromise solution

       Well then what can a poor boy do
       except to sing for a rock and roll band
       'cause this sleepy London town
       Is just no place for a street fighting man! No!

      Hey, said my name is called disturbance
      I'll shout and scream
      I'll kill the king
      I'll rail at all his servants

       Well what can a poor boy do
       except to sing for a rock and roll band
       'cause this sleepy run down town
       Is just no place for a street fighting man!

Prodigal Son

by Rev. Wilkins


      Well a poor boy took his father's bread and started down the road
      started down the road
      Took all he had and started down the road
      Went out of his world, where God only knows
      And that'll be the way to get along

      Well poor boy spent all he had, famine swept the land
      famine swept the land
      Spent all he had and famine swept the land
      Said "I believe I'll go and hire me to some man"
      And that'll be the way to get along

      Well, man said "I'll give you a job for to feed my swine
      For to feed my swine
      I'll give you a job for to feed my swine"
      Boy stood there and hung his head and cried
      `Cause that is no way to get along

      Said "I believe I'll ride, believe I'll go back home
      Believe I'll go back home
      Believe I'll ride, believe I'll go back home
      Or down the road as far as I can go"
      And that'll be the way to get along

      Well, father said see my son coming home to me
      Coming home to me
      Father ran and fell down on his knees
      Said "sing and praise, lord have mercy on me"
      They said

      Oh poor boy stood there, hung his head and cried
      Hung his head and cried
      Poor boy stood there, hung his head and cried
      Said "father will you look on me as a child?"
      Yeah

      Well father said "eldest son, kill the fatted calf,
      call the family round
      Kill that calf and call the family round
      My son was lost but now he is found
      But that's the way for us to get along"
      Hey

Stray Cat Blues


      I hear the click-clack of your feet on the stairs
      I know you're no scare-eyed honey.
      There'll be a feast if you just come upstairs
      But it's no hanging matter
      It's no capital crime

      I can see that you're fifteen years old
      No I don't want your I.D.
      And I can see that you're so far from home
      But it's no hanging matter
      It's no capital crime

      Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
      Oh yeah, don'tcha scratch like that
      Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
      bet your mama don't know you scream like that
      I bet your mother don't know that you spit like that.

      You look so weird and you're so far from home
      but you really miss your mother
      Don't look so scared I'm no mad-brained bear
      But it's no hanging matter
      It's no capital crime

      Bet your mama don't know you scream like that
      I bet your mother don't know that you bite like that.

      You say you got a friend, she's wilder than you
      Well, why don't you bring her upstairs
      If she's so wild she can join in too
      But it's no hanging matter
      It's no capital crime

      Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
      Oh yeah, don'tcha scratch like that
      Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
      bet you mama don't know you scream like that
      I bet your mother don't know that you bite like that
      I'll bet she never saw you scratch my back

Factory Girl


      Waiting for a girl who's got curlers in her hair
      Waiting for a girl she has no money anywhere
      We get buses everywhere
      Waiting for a factory girl

      Waiting for a girl and her knees are much too fat
      Waiting for a girl who weares scarves instead of hat
      Her zipper's broken down the back
      Waiting for a factory girl

      Waiting for a girl and she gets me into fights
      Waiting for a girl we get drunk on friday nights
      She's a sight for sore eyes
      Waiting for a factory girl

      Waiting for a girl and she's got stains all down her dress
      Waiting for a girl and my feet are getting wet
      She ain't come out yet
      Waiting for a factory girl

Salt of the Earth


      Lets drink to the hard working people
      Lets drink to the lowly of birth
      Raise your glass to the good and the evil
      Lets drink to the salt of the earth

      Say a prayer for the common foot soldier
      Spare a thought for his back breaking work
      Say a prayer for his wife and his children
      Who burn the fires and who still till the earth

       And when i search a faceless crowd
       a swirling mass of gray and
       black and white
       they don't look real to me
       in fact, they look so strange

      Raise your glass to the hard working people
      Lets drink to the uncounted heads
      Lets think of the wavering millions
      Who need leaders but get gamblers instead

      Spare a thought for the stay-at-home voter
      His empty eyes gaze at strange beauty shows
      And a parade of the gray suited grafters
      A choice of cancer or polio

       And when i search a faceless crowd
       A swirling mass of gray and
       Black and white
       They don't look real to me
       In fact, they look so strange

      Lets drink to the hard working people
      Lets think of the lowly of birth
      Spare a thought for the rag taggy people
      Lets drink to the salt of the earth

      Lets drink to the hard working people
      Lets drink to the salt of the earth
      Lets think of the two thousand million
      Lets think of the humble of birth
