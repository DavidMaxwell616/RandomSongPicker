Subject: TAB: <All the Young Dudes> by <David Bowie>

All of my postings were picked out by ear, so if you see of any mistakes, 
please mail me. I have posted them because I can't really agree with the 
previous postings.

The Mott the Hoople version from 1972 was recorded in D major. Bowie's 
studio version from 1973 (now available on RarestOneBowie) is in between C 
and B major (I think), probably because of the playback speed. I'm not sure 
about available live recordings by either artists. The lyrics between the 
two studio versions vary slightly - Bowie's lyrics are used here; however, I 
chose to write the music in D major rather than get involved with the C 
major/B major deal.

In D major:

        The first four measures of the verse contain an ascending D major 
scale down to A. The beginning of each measure gets one note.

Now Lucy's looking sweet, though he dresses like a queen, he can
kick like a mule, its a real mean team.
We can love, we can love.
And my brother's back at home with his Beatles and his Stones we

What a drag - too many snags.

Ok, here we go. This is my first post, so deep breaths. This is quite
tricky to play in parts. It's based on the 'David Live' version - as
I don't have a copy of Mott the Hopple! Have fun. Comments corrections
etc, mail me.
