WHISKEY, YOU'RE THE DEVIL

Whiskey, you're the devil, you're leading me astray
F              C         G
Over hills and mountains unto Amerikay
       C                                  F              C

Oh whiskey you're me darlin' drunk or sober.

Drums are beating, banners flying The divil a home we'll come tonight

Said the mother do not wrong me Don't take me daughter from me
F                      C                   G
For if you do I will torment you And after death me ghost will haunt you

Now the French are fightin' boldly Men are dying hot and coldly
F                     C                   G
Give every men his flask of powder His firelock on his shoulder,
C                                                      F
