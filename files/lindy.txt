Ever' chance, the women; watch-it's amazing ?dance?

Oh Mama, don't you weep and moan,
Uncle Sam got your man and gone.
Now they're doin' the Lindy Bird across the sea.

Verse End Lick

Oh Mama, how can it be?
You went way across the sea
Just to keep from doing that Lindy thing with me
(Oh baby, well I done just told'ja now)

Oh Mama, don't you weep and moan,
Uncle Sam got your man and gone.
Now then they're doin' the Lindy Bird across the sea.

I asked her for a piece of banana
She said, "Let me play the blues on your piano
And then I'll do that Lindy thing with you."
(Mary had a dream about a submarine.)

I asked her for a glass of K-ola
She said, "Let me play the blues on your Victrola,
And then I'll do that Lindy thing with you."
