Here's a rough interpretation of this song for guitar. If anybody wants,
feel free to embellish/correct. Happy riffing.

Billy Joel
My Life
-------------

Intro/Fill/Outro: D-Bm-Am-C9-Ebmaj7-Bb

D                                             G
Got a call from an old friend we'd used to be real close
A                                   D
Said he couldn't go on the American way
                                                        G
Closed the shop, sold the house, bought a ticket to the west coast
A                                         D    [Fill]
Now he gives them a stand-up routine in L.A.
D                                           G
I don't need you to worry for me cause I'm allright
A                                             D
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
                                          G
I don't care what you say anymore this is my life
A                                         Bm
Go ahead with your own life leave me alone
                                    F#
I never said you had to offer me a second chance
D7                             E9
I never said I was a victim of circumstance
G            D
I still belong
F#           Bm
Don't get me wrong
E9
And you can speak your mind
    G   A  G  A
But not on my time
D                                             G
They will tell you you can't sleep alone in a strange place
A                                               D
Then they'll tell you can't sleep with somebody else
                                         G
Ah but sooner or later you sleep in your own space
A                                         D
Either way it's O.K. you wake up with yourself
