Subject: "Moving In Stereo"  by The Cars
Here it is:  The song made famous by Judge Reinholt as he dreamed of
Phoebe Cates in "Fast Times at Ridgemont High".
The chords I picked out are match the intro and the verses...the same 
chords are individually picked during the chorus, but they are in a 
different order...if anyone figures out that I am way off, please e-mail
me...Have Fun!

Moving In Stereo

Play power chords on the D and A strings:
E D D F# E....E D D E...E D D F# E...E D C....
Life's the same, you're moving in stereo...
That pretty much covers the rhythm...
