WHEN I PAINT MY MASTERPIECE- Bob Dylan

                    G         C/G          G
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble
           D               G
Ancient footprints are everywhere
          G                       C/G      G
You can almost think that you're seein' double
                 D                     G
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs
D7                                G    
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room
D7                                          G
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece
        G                C/G               G
She promised that she'd be right there with me 
        D              G
When I paint my masterpiece

Oh, the hours I've spent inside the Coliseum
Dodging lions and wastin' time
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle
I could hardly stand to see 'em
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb
Train wheels runnin' through the back of my memory
When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese 
Someday, everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
When I paint my masterpiece

BRIDGE:
 Cm                                 G
Sailin'round the world in a dirty gondola
Bm            C                    D     C  G  A7  D7
Oh to be back in the land of Coca Cola!

I left Rome and landed in Brussels
On a plane ride so bumpy that I almost cried
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pullin' muscles
Everyone was there to greet me when I stepped inside
Newspapermen eating candy had to be held down by big police 
Someday, everything is gonna be different
        D              G Am G
When I paint my masterpiece
