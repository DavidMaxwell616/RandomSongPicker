Hi Jim:
That's what I have handy, The chords are quite simple,
drop me a line if you have problems.

I Can See Clearly Now

D          G               D
I can see clearly now the rain is gone
D          G            A
I can see all obstacles in my way
D             G                D
Gone all the dark clouds that made me blind
                 C                 G                         D
It's gonna be a bright, (bright) bright, (bright) sun shiny day
                 C                 G                         D
It's gonna be a bright, (bright) bright, (bright) sun shiny day

Yes I can make it now the pain is gone,
All of the bad feelings have disappeared.
Here is the rainbow I have been praying for.
It's gonna be a bright, (bright) bright, (bright) sun shiny day

F                                     C
Look all around, there's nothing but blue skies
F                                         A         C#m G C#m G C Bm A
Look straight ahead, there's nothing but blue skies _________

I can see clearly now the rain is gone
I can see all obstacles in my way
Here is the rainbow I have been praying for.
It's gonna be a bright, (bright) bright, (bright) sun shiny day
It's gonna be a bright, (bright) bright, (bright) sun shiny day
