Get off my ass you wee bitty fuck
                                  D           G
If I pull out the Claymore you're shit out of luck
G
Who's that girl?  That pretty young thing
                         D          G
After I fuck her, she'll get up and sing

G   Em  D       G                      D             G
Aye aye aye  -- Sharpen your boot, and bludgeon your eye
G   Em  D          G                      D          G
Aye aye aye -- The Blareny Stone brings a tear to me eye

Down to the pub for a two shilling ale
The bread on the counter is going stale
If I don't get some fresh bread soon
Gonna punch you in your face and bark at the moon

Aye aye aye -- Sharpen your boot, and bludgeon your eye
Aye aye aye -- The Blareny Stone brings a tear to me eye

Ain't got no girl 'cuz I haven't the time
Got too many other things on me mind
Patty was nice, she was young pale and cute
But I threw her away like an old piece of fruit

Aye aye aye -- Sharpen your boot, and bludgeon your eye
Aye aye aye -- The Blareny Stone brings a tear to me eye

Got oooze in my pores, my feet are all wet
Got mold in my ears, but I ain't dead yet
Got stones in my bladder, got a crack in me head
When Patty starts cryin' this is what I said

Aye aye aye -- Sharpen your boot, and bludgeon your eye
Aye aye aye -- The Blareny Stone brings a tear to me eye
