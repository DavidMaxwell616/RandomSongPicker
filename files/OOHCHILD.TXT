OK, show of hands:  How many of you *knew* from the subject line who
posted this?  :-)


The Five Stairsteps were a pre-Jackson 5 family act from Chicago.  They
were best known as proteges of Curtis Mayfield, who wrote some of their
early singles, produced nearly all of them, and released them on his own
Windy C and Curtom labels.  ('Ooh Child', though, was written and produced
by Stan Vincent and appeared on Curtom's distributor, Buddah.)

They had 17 singles on the Hot 100 (plus several more on the R&B chart),
but this was their only major (#8) pop hit (although if someone asks
nicely, I might transcribe 'World Of Fantasy').

Various configurations continued to record as 'Stairsteps' and
'Invisible Man's Band' for George Harrison's 'Dark Horse' label well
into the 1980s.
