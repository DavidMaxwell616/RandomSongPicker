All the way, he's a mighty good leader

All the way, way up to heaven 
He took my mother, all the way

A            C#
open up the door
         D                   A
lay the orange juice on the floor
               G#            D             A
we're having a picnic on the ugly part of town 

the sleeping bags on fire
and its getting down to the wire
so grab a sofa spot and settle down awhile 

cause its getting hard to think
and my clothes are starting to shrink
and the moon is sagging down like a metal ball

and the world is a holiday
smoking in an old ashtray
they just blow it out their nose and say ok

so lets try to make this last
the past is still the past
and tomorrow is just another crazy scam

(repeat first verse)

Lyrics: 


Well there aint nobody left to impress 
and everyone's kissing their own hands 
its 666 on the kichen floor 
aint no fire in the pan 

I get lonesome (4x)

(repeat intro)

so glad to be a slab 
stiff as a stick on a board 
i get thoughts and dirty socks 
piled in the corner 

i get lonesome (4x) 

D7 G D7 G

Getting fat on your own fears 
bring that beer over here 
i stomp on the floor 
just to make a sound 

i get lonesome (4x)

D7 G (6x) 
ooooooh

4. Burnt Orange Peel

B
I'm on the run with things to be (we're on the road/we're on the run)
I've got a garden hose and a color tv
          A#   F#    B
I've got time on my hands
          A#   F#    B
I've got time on my hands
E           G#  B
Nobody cares    what I do 

I'm on the run with things to do (we're on the road/long ago)
I've got a burnt orange peel and a potato stew
I've got work to get done
I've got work to get done
Nobody knows where to run 

(up 1/2 step)

I've got a quart of milk and some sound advice
I've got 
But they smell so nice
Don't give me the flu
Nobody knows I'm with you 

(up 1/2 step)

Back and forth I dodge a fly
Like a feather in the sky
Write me out a check
Give me all your cash
Nobody knows, so let's just go home

5. CYANIDE BREATH MINT

Tune guitar down one full step
 
A           F               D             G 
   Definitely, this is the wrong place to be 
         F            C 
there's blood on the futon, 
           E            A 
there's a kid drinkin' fire. 
                   F 
Goin' down to the sea, 
          D         G 
they got people to meet, 
         F              C 
shakin' hands with themselves, 

         E           F      Gb
lookin' out for themselves. 

C             F           G 
   When they ask you for credit, 
 F           C 
give them a branch. 
C             F           G 
   When they want you to get it, 
 F           C 
chew on the grass. 
   E       F 
I know, I know 
             D          G 
'cause they told me to tell you 
          F         C 
there's nothing to tell you, 
          E         A 
there's nothing to sell you. 

In the afternoon, riding the scapegoat, 
burning equipment, decomposing. 
Cool off your jets, 
take off your sweats, 
I got a funny feeling 
they got plastic in the afterlife. 

When they want you to cry, 
leap into the sky. 
When they suck your mind, 
like a pigeon you fly. 
I know, I know, 
it's the positive people 
running from their time 
looking for some feeling.

Who's going to miss you

Dry up on the shoreline
drinking everything you see
offering things to the ladies
bowing down in the mossen trees

A        D
Climb up into
A                 D
Nobody's going to miss you

Lyrics: 

go where you want to 
do the things you feel 
walk around with a broken leg 
and a hundred dollar bill 

get yourself a pistol 
get yourself a dog 
stay up all night gettin' drunk 
sleepin' on a hollow log 

walk till your restless 
sleep till your tired 
wake up without thinking 
your the one that I desire

stand outside with a suitcase
(there's a forcefield round my neck)
walk around all the while
(and it stands just where I sat)
look at the people driving backwards
(and the stance I took on that)
no particular style
(leaves that forcefield round my back)

don't let it get near you
don't let it get too close
don't let it turn you into
(and the stance I took on that)
the things you hate the most
(leaves a forcefield round my neck)

roll out your silver-dollar coffins
pull out your buckskin gloves
tell them anything you want to
the sound comes from above

Fourteen rivers
fourteen floods
send your body to the heavens above.
Don't get drunk
don't get dry
just bring your money next Saturday night.

Forty miles on a cattle trail
with a happy mule
and nothing on my mind
all my life I've been talking fast
taking all the things
that I should have let pass.

Throw my hat on a coffee mill
put another brick
in the fire place.
Well I don't know about you or me
but some got loose
back on down.

11. ASSHOLE

tune guitar down 1 1/2 steps

(C E A)4x

      C           E              A 
Your brains went black when she took back her love 
     C      E            A 
and put it out into the sun 
      C        E            A 
The birds did fly when the heavens all went dry 
         C               E            A 
And the cigarettes are smokin by themselves 

CHORUS 
F 
She'll do anything 
E 
She'll do anything 
A              C 
She'll do anything to make you feel like an asshole 

Call her name, she looks the same as you 
question mark stretched across the skin 
She dangles carrots, makes you feel embarrassed 
to be the fool you know you are 

(Chorus)

13. I`VE SEEN THE LAND BEYOND

tune down 1/2 step

F 
From these shores where we belong 
        C             F 
I have seen the land beyond 

Where the lord is strange and strong 
        C             F 
I have seen the land beyond 

           Bb                 F 
There's no telling who'll be dead 
          C                    F 
When the pale horse is turning red 
           Bb                   F 
And their tongues will burn in vain 
          C                   F 
And everything will feel the same 

There's no patience there's no peace 
I have seen the land beyond 
Where the gravestones never cease 
I have seen the land beyond 

Through the troubles of the years 
A heavenly apparition appears 
And we're haunted by our own minds 
And the spirit calls in the skies 

From these shores where we belong 
I have seen the land beyond 
I'll be there and I'll be gone 
I have seen the land beyond

Seventeen years in the city
static clinging to the ceiling

never did I think it would come to this
how come it's different than I expected
never did I think it would come to this
how come it's different than I expected

Riot cops cheerleaders
eyebrows painted on their heads
mouthful of rotting cavities
drinking coca cola in the street

(chorus)

Shot in the leg
shot in the leg
my name is a bone
nobody home
my hand is a wire
the sky is on fire
the drums aren't beating
pistols in jeans
laugh at the dead
laugh at the dead
love if you're dead
dead as a fly

I first met you down on Lover's Lane 
      F#          C     D           G 
The birds were insane flapping all about 
A                C     G                F#
Softly you would sing swinging in your swing 
C          D               G 
It wasn't night it wasn't day

15. PAINTED EYELIDS

guitar tuned down 1/2 step

A                             E
I wake up and look upon your painted eyelids
     F#                          E7
The world is your oyster and the trash bags are your kids
     A                              E
The ceiling is invisible there's a bird sinkin thru the sky
F#                             E7 
And every hour that passes is teachin me how to cry
          D7                 A
Cuz it's lonely here in the ugly part of town
     B7                               E7
The buildings are all vacant and the telephones are down

There's a police siren singing like a tiger with no skin
The sewer drain is glowing and I don't know what state I'm in
And the river is on fire there's chemicals and debris
And all the roads are blocked off they're just too hard to see
So cancel my appointments and set up a whole new show
Cuz I'm in need of a good hot meal and a life to call my own

(Harmonica solo over A-E-F#-E7)

So get me a plate of money get me a blanket and a chair
The limitations are limitless they're floating thru the air
Cuz it's real and it's true the things I see in you
And there's nothin I wouldn't talk about with the clearest dream
                  A
that ever drifted by
