I go out by myself and watch the people as they go by
everybody's looking for the place way up in the sky
lives wouldn't be the same
as if to be alone was something to be ashamed
why do fools claim no
just cause I'm alone don't mean I'm unhappy
so judge me true about what I say and not what I do
why do fools continue to say that I'm not over you
not over you

Everybody tells me that I should be with someone
Everybody looking for a place way up with the sun
Searching for a love though nobody knows quite why
Like it's a drug with some means for them to get high
still all the while they claim my smile is a charade
what do these people know anyway
who cares what they say

So everybody says I'm sitting here missing you
but I'm sitting here cause sitting is what I choose
so judge me true about what I say and not what I do
why do fools continue to say that I'm not over you
not over you
not over you

somebody tell 
tell me why can't I be happy having no one else
why must the sun rise and fall on someone else
