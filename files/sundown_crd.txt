      G  
I can see her lyin' back in her satin dress
      D7                                  G
In a room where you do what you don't confess.
 G             C        
Sundown, you better take care
      F                          G          
If I find you bin creepin' round my back stairs.
Sundown, you better take care
If I find you bin creepin' round my back stairs.
                                                   
She's bin lookin' like a queen in a sailor's dream
And she don't always say what she really means.
Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain.
Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain.
                                                   
I can picture ev'ry move that a man could make;
Gettin' lost in her lovin' is your first mistake.
Sundown, you better take care
If I find you bin creepin' round my back stairs.
Sometimes I think it's a sin
When I feel like I'm winnin' when I'm losin' again.
                                                   
I can see her lookin' fast in her faded jeans;
She's a hard lovin' woman, got me feelin' mean.
Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain.
Sundown, you better take care
If I find you bin creepin' round my back stairs.
                                                   
Sundown you better take care
If I find you bin creepin' round my back stairs.
Sometimes I think it's a sin
When I feel like I'm winnin' when I'm losin' again.
