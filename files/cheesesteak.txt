CHEESESTEAK BLUES

C                                                    A7
We were so good together, a better team you couldn't find
C                                                    A7
but the way she tortured me I had to drink myself blind. 

F#                   D                
Mathematic advertize taproom laughter scrutinize 
C                            E 
three wise men fertilize and jesus neil stigmatize

That girl she drove me crazy, up and over the wall
Good God, good grief, good riddance and thank you alcohol
untrained monkeys fleabit thighs babysitter's anguished sighs 
subway urchin's bloodshot eyes sunday shopping nobel prize

Now that  it's all over, I'm  free to do as I please
Pounding whiskey women darvon novril helps me keep my mind at ease 
This ending's caught me by surprise, and now it's time to close my eyes
before I'm  forced to realize these are only alibis

original lyrics (controversial)

You know I love you baby you're the one who makes me hot
but if you come home late tonight I will kill you on the spot

I will sneak up by surprise and gouge out both your eyes
Large cheesesteak and two small fries, take time to realize

you know i tell ya honey everything you want to hear
but if you try to cross me I will stick an icepick in your ear

(chorus)

I'll miss you doll you meant the world to me
I'll take just what I need and toss your carcass out to sea
