JUST THE SAME

D             D9/B
Every time I talk to you
     D9/C           G5              D
You tell me how I ought to live my life
D             D9/B
You act as if I envy you
     D9/C            G5             D
And every choice you ever made was right
        C               Bm
You forget the times I bailed you out
Am               Fm               G  G7sus
All the times I had to take the blame
     D                   D/C
You feed yourself on my damages
    D/B              D/Bb    
And use me up but I love you 
          Am    A
just the same

It’s not enough that I open up 
and bare the secrets that you yourself would hide
But then you publicize them and wonder
Why no one cares when you cry
Sometimes it’s so difficult to understand
Your pointless unwinnable game
I’m just glad I’m too stupid to know better
Than to love you just the same

It must be so wonderful 
to be so doubtless, so unflawed and so pure
Better just to raise your voice 
than to ever admit that you’re not really sure
Now that you've forgiven yourself
your conscience still whispers out my name
I know it's probably killing me
but I still love you just the same
