RELUCTANT NOVELTY
(MY ONE BLUE GLOVE)

dropped d tuning

D                F            C                        A7
Pigeon left his hole behind against the wind but unconfined
Do you hate to love or do you love to hate
is it too much too early or too little too late
Hit the snooze button on my conscience
rough sex works better than tough love
sordid escapades and statutory offense
bad checks morning breath and boxing gloves

chorus:
F6                 
You don't need no eyes to see
G7
that I'm a reluctant novelty
F6
who had to flee from the cavalry
A                            A#     A
no longer referee for your family tree

Took a crash and burn course in unwritten law
trained in maybe-sayers and their springtime thaw
When your motor control is out on parole 
put your body and soul on my kaiser roll

>

When the cookie cutters and powerlust
are shimmering ashes reduced to dust
her fragrant memories are stinking up my mind
see my reason dethroned see my mastercard declined

>

Misguided confidence fills my sails 
I leave trust to the blind let bombast prevail
with deerpath guidance, my compass amiss
sweatstained directions clenched in my fist
I'm a strident sasquatch, loping cognito
and I'll debug the pillaging concrete mosquito
