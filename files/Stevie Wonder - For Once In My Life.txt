...FOR ONCE IN MY LIFE... by Stevie Wonder
-------------------------.................

*CAPO 3rd FRET*

(Original Key: Bb)

Verse 1:

    G          G+          G6          G7
For once in my life I have someone who needs me
Am            F         D7
 Someone I've needed so long
    Am        F            D7            D7#5
For once, un-afraid, I can go where life leads me
    G         D7           G
And somehow I know I'll be strong

Chorus 1:

    G          G6            E+      
For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of
C              Am   Dm7 D7           
 Long before I knew
Gmaj7    Bm        Em
 Someone warm like you
      Em7     A7          Am7  D7
Would make my dreams come true

Verse 2:

(D7) G          G+           G6         G7
For  once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Am           F          D7
 Not like it hurt me be-fore
    Am           F           D7            D7#5
For once, I have something I know won't de-sert me
G          D7       G
 I'm not a-lone any-more

Chorus 2:

    G           G6           E+  
For once, I can say, this is mine, you can't take it
   C                     A7
As long as I know I have love, I can make it
    G          G+           C        Am7 D7    G
For once in my life, I have some-one who needs me

Chorus 3:

    G          G+            Am7    D7    Cdim Em  A7
For once I can feel that somebody's heard my   plea
    G          G+           C        Am7 D7    G   Bb  G6 
For once in my life, I have some-one who needs me...

 Some-one who needs me
G         Bb        G6
 Some-one who needs me
