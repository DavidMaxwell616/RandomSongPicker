C# A F#

I knew something was wrong 
it went on too long
then it just crumbled

I'm still looking for you
in somebody else
I can't help myself

I need to stumble

when I met you 
I thought you were through 
messing with people's minds
but you're not done 
you're on the run 
leaving destruction behind

I should know by now
