Note: When you are playing the chorus in order to get it to sound right in
your head the melody can be played like this:

 C        G             F                 A#                     C

Well I'm here    to re-mind you   of the mess you left when you went away


*This is NOT the lead tab but rather the melody as it is sung with the
chords.  If this isn't correct or whatever than I don't want to here from
you because I've yet to see anyone else do any better :)
