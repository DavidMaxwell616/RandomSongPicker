Bob Dylan - Things Have Changed

Am 
A worried man with a worried mind 
Dm
No one in front of me and nothing behind 
          Am                                    E7
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne 
Am
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes 
Dm
I'm looking up into the sapphire tinted skies 
Am                                E7    Am
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train 
F7                                           Am
Standin' on the gallows with my head in the noose 
F7                                              E7
Any minute now I'm expectin' all hell to break loose 

People are crazy and times are strange 
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range 
I used to care but - things have changed. 

This place ain't doin' me any good 
I'm in the wrong town, I should've been in Hollywood 
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move 
Gonna take dancin' lessons, do the jitterbug rag 
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag 
Only a fool in here would think he got anythin' to prove 
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too 
Don't get up gentlemen, I'm only passing through 

Chorus

I've been walkin' forty miles of bad road 
If the Bible is right the world will explode 
I'm tryin' to get as far away from myself as I can 
Some things are too hot to touch 
The human mind can only stand so much 
You can't win with a losing hand 
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet 
Puttin' her in a wheelbarrow and wheelin' her down the street 

Chorus

I hurt easy, I just don't show it 
You can hurt someone and not even know it 
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity 
Gonna get lowdown, gonna fly high 
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie 
I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me 
Mr. Jinx and miss Lucy they jumped in a lake 
I'm not that eager to make a mistake 

Chorus
