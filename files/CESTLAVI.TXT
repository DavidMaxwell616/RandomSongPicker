Intro

D
It was a teen-aged wedding 
D
And the old folks wished them well
D
You could see that Pierre
                       A
Truly loved the mademoiselle
A
And now the young Monsieur and Madame
A
Have rung the chapel bell
A
C'est La Vie say the old folks
                              D
It goes to show you never can tell
They furnished off the apartment
With a two room tag-end sale
The coolerator was crammed
With TV dinners and Ginger Ale
But when Pierre found work
The little money come in, worked out well
C'est La Vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
They had a hi-fi phono
Boy, did they let it blast
700 little records
All rock and rhythm and jazz
But when the sun went down
The rapid tempo of the music fell
C'est La Vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
They bought a souped up chitney 
Was cherry red fifty-three
Drove it down to Orleans
To celebrate their anniversary
It was their where Pierre was wedded
To the lovely mademoiselle
C'est La Vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
It was a teen-aged wedding 
And the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre
Truly loved the mademoiselle
And now the young Monsieur and Madame
Have rung the chapel bell
C'est La Vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
