SPIDERMAN

capo 3rd fret

Am
Spiderman spiderman does whatever a spider can
Dm                   Am
spins a web any size catches thieves just like flies
E                          Am
look out here comes the spiderman
is he strong? listen bud he's got radioactive blood
can he swing from a thread take a look overhead
hey there there goes the spiderman
        G        C            E           Am       
in the chill of night at the scene of a crime
         G        C        Bm7             E
like a streak of light he arrives just in time

Spiderman spiderman friendly neighborhood spiderman
wealth and fame, he's ignored 
action is his reward
to him life is a great big bang up
wherever there's a hang up 
you'll find the spiderman
