Dm  A
 
           Dm
When I was seventeen
         Eb *
It was a very good year
         Dm                 F
It was a very good year for small town girls
    Eb
And soft summer nights
     D
We’d hide from the lights
       C
On the village green
           D
When I was seventeen
 
Dm  A
 
           Dm
When I was twenty-one
         Eb
It was a very good year
         Dm                 F
It was a very good year for city girls
    Eb
Who lived up the stair
              D
With all that perfumed hair
       C
and it came undone
           D
When I was twenty-one
 
Dm A
 
           Dm
When I was thirty-five
         Eb
It was a very good year
         Dm                 F
It was a very good year for blue-blooded girls
   Eb
Of independent means
     D
We’d ride in limousines
      C
Their chauffeurs would drive
           D
When I was thirty-five
 
Dm A
 
            Dm
But now the days are short
           Eb
I'm in the autumn of the year
    Dm                  F
And now I think of my life as vintage wine
     Eb
from fine old kegs
         D
from the brim to the dregs
     C
It’s oh sweet and clear
         D
It was a very good year
 
Dm  A
