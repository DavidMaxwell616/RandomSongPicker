(Cough! Cough! Cough!) 
       D            A            D
When Reginald was home with the flu, uh-huh-huh,
      D     A                 G   D
The doctor knew just what to do-hoo.
    A
He cured the infection
With one small injection
       G                     D    G    D
While Reginald uttered some interjections.. 

Hey! That smarts!
Ouch! That hurts!
Yow! That's not fair givin' a guy a shot down there! 

D   D G   D    
Interjections (Well!) show excitement (Oh!) or emotion (Hey!).
 A                                           G                   D
They're generally set apart from a sentence by an exclamation point,
A                       G                 D
Or by a comma when the feeling's not as strong. 


Though Geraldine played hard to get, uh-huh-huh
Geraldo knew he'd woo her ye-het
He showed his affection
Despite her objections
And Geraldine hollered some interjections... 

Well! You've got some nerve!
Oh! I've never been so insulted in all my life!
Hey! You're kinda cute! 

>Chorus

                 G                 D
So when you're happy (Hurray!) or sad (Aw!)
      G                      D
Or frightened (Eeeeeek!) or mad (Rats!)
     G                 D
Or excited (Wow!) or glad (Hey!)
     E                              A
An interjection starts a sentence right. 

The game was tied at seven all, uh-huh-huh,
When Franklin found he had the ba-hall.
He made a connection
In the other direction,
And the crowd started shouting out interjections... 

Aw! You threw the wrong way!
Darn! You just lost the game!
Hurray! I'm for the other team! 

Interjections (Aw!) show excitement (Darn!) or emotion (Hurray!).
They're generally set apart from a sentence by an exclamation point,
Or by a comma when the feeling's not as strong. 

So when you're happy (Hurray!) or sad (Aw!)
Or frightened (Eeeeeek!) or mad (Rats!)
Or excited (Wow!) or glad (Hey!)
An interjection starts a sentence right. 

Interjections (Hey!) show excitement (Hey!) or emotion (Hey!).
They're generally set apart from a sentence by an exclamation point,
Or by a comma when the feeling's not as strong. 

Interjections show excitement or emotion,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah... YEA! 

Darn! That's the end!
