   Suspicious Minds  (By Mark James)

     ================

Sung by Elvis Presley; (c) Press Music, Inc. 

G                        C                  
  
  We're caught in a trap;  I can't walk out

D               C               G

  because I love you too much,  baby.

G                    C
  
Why can't you see,   what you're doing to me,

D                      C          D     C  Bm  D7 
 
  when you don't believe a word I say?

(1st Chorus:)
 
 C                G        Bm                  C    D  
 
    We can't go on together, with Suspicious Minds;
 
 Em                  Bm          C              D       D7 
 
    and we can't build our dreams, on Suspicious Minds.

.
G                              C
  
So, if an old friend I know, drops by to say hello,

D                 C           G
 
 would I still see suspicion in your eyes?

G                  C           
 
 Here we go again, asking where I've been.
D                       C               D      C  Bm  D7
 
  You can see these tears are real I'm crying.  

(2nd Chorus:)

  C                G        Bm                  C
   
  We can't go on together, with Suspicious Minds;
  
Em                  Bm           C              B7sus4   B7
 
    and we can't build our dreams, on Suspicious Minds...


       Em             Bm            C
         
 Oh, let our love survive, 
                       D
       
   I'll dry the tears from your eyes.
  
     Em                   Bm             C  
      
    Let's don't let a good thing die,  when honey,
  
           D                G               C    G       D7
   
       you know I've never,  lied to you;   Mmm,  yeah,  yeah!

 			Suspicious minds
			  Elvis Presley

  G			C
We're caught in a trap, I can't walk out
  D	    C		     G
Because I love you too much baby.
 		   C
Why can't you see what you're doing to me
  D		  C		 D	C Bm D
When you don't believe a word I say ?

C	    G		 Bm		  C	D Em
We can't go on together with suspicious minds,
	      Bm	      C		     D
And we can't build our dreams on suspicious minds.

So if an old friend I know drops by to say hello,
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes ?
But here we go again, asking where I'd been,
And can't you see these tears are real I'm crying

We can't go on together ...

Em	     Bm
Oh, let our love survive
C	     D
Ah, dry the tears from my eyes
Em		   Bm
Let's don't let a good thing die
C		    D		   G   C     G     D7
There's gonna be nobody ever like you, um - yeah, yeah.

We caught in a trap ...


Hope you`ll enjoy it. Bye, Matthias.
