Dear Max,<BR>
<BR>
I think you'll like this little ditty, I call:<BR>
<BR>
 VATICAT

G       Dm              C         Am                              
Jesus planted his sow among seeds,
G       Dm                       Am                              
with a hoe, Moses supped in tender reeds,
hoe down Mississippi, grampa's in the ground, 
hoe down, down to the shore,
a blue car skids to a halt under sun,
and out of it crops men in beaver suits
hoe down
Dm                Bm   C      A   
Ala carte Alaska skin boned salmon
aloe ishus in the thin tin can
of time, cropped dandelions,
purple sexed percocets dissolved
unnoticed in your rancid wine,
chop cheese, Aloe ishus, this is spring
when all the madness grows
green, and plants get toiled as Jesus
rants and hoes up soil, whoa King Biscuit
tattooed elegance that mirrors my own
toe as it pokes a hole in your wooden angel
sunshine shore, you Pope an eye out
with your holy sceptre, Vaticat has claws
and acres of earth to paw,
like a leopard holds a leper in its loving jaws.
Chop Me into littler Me's, aloe Ishus,
Boom Boom!
