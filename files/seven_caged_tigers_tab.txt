"7 Caged Tigers" -- Stone Temple Pilots

(Intro)

G Bm  E
D C  B 

(verse 1)

E             G          C            
Pass the time kickin' as time rips by
G          Bm         E
Neither goose nor the gander fly
G       Bm                  E
Buy a minute spend an hour burnin', burnin'
D                  C     B           
Take a peek as the model earns it, earns it
E                 G     C 
Walk a mile as it keeps crawlin', crawlin'
G         Bm          E
Clean the politician, wash him with everpure

(chorus)

D#                 A#
So the answer gets harder, harder
D#                      A#
And the truth's getting farther and farther
D#                   A#
And the bottle keeps churnin' and churnin'
D#                 A#    B
Seven caged tigers fly by fly by fly by

(verse 2,3)

G       Bm                 E
Wastin' time chasin' those cows that fly
D            C        B         
Churnin' out all that butterfly sugarboost
E         G                  C                   
Track the blade as it sweeps downward and onward
G                 Bm           E
Take a pill it'll kill all the martyrs, martyrs
G            Bm         E
Passin' time rippin' as time kicks by
D        C               B          
Pass the umbilical chord down for a fly by
E                      G     C                 
Take a sneak while the model earns it, earns it
G           Bm          E
Hike a mile as it keeps crawlin' crawlin'
