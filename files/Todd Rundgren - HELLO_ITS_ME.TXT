	I've thought about us for a long, long time

	Maybe I think too much but something's wrong
	Cm7                                 Bbmaj7
	There's something here that doesn't last too long

	Sometimes I can't help seeing all the way through

	Gm9     Fmaj9
	Think of me
	Gm9                          Fmaj9  [continue as per verse 1]
	You know that I'd be with you if I could
	I'll come around to see you once in a while
	Or if I ever need a reason to smile
	And spend the night if you think I should

	[repeat chorus; modulate to F#]
