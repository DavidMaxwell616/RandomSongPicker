Well I finally sat down with the Singles CD and bashed this out.  I can
play the riff at the beginning, but now that I don't have my guitar
in hand I forget it.  Agh.  I can't understand two places where Chrissy
is singing either--'crescending' and 'baggle' aren't words that I know
of, but that sounds like what she's saying.  Corrections appreciated.

Back on the Chain Gang, the Pretenders

opening strum: D A G G D A G G

riff x2

D         A            G     G
I found a picture of you   oh
What hijacked my world at nights
To a place in the past we've been passed out of  oh
Now we're back in the fight

Em                A
We're back on the train (ooh, ah)
Ohh
A               D            A   G   G
    Back on the chain gang

The circumstance beyond our control oh
The fool on TV and the news of the world
Got in the house like a pigeon from hell, oh
Crescending our eyes and descended like flies

Put us back on the train, yeah
Oh
Back on the chain gang

D A G G

riff x2

bridge: 
Dm A Dm A and so on
The powers that be
That forces us to live like we do
Bring me to my knees
When I see what they've done to you

chord comping

I'll die as I stand here today
Knowing that deep in my heart
A                     Dm
Therefore to ruin one day
A             E
For making us part-----

E         B          A    A
I found a picture of you, oh
Those were the happiest days of my life
Like a brick in the baggle was your part, oh
In the wretched life of a lonely heart

F#m                   B
Now we're back on the train
Ohh
B             E
  Back on the chain gang

NOTE:  If you find Gmaj/B too hard to finger, try Bm in its place.  Not 
as accurate, but a hell of a lot easier.

There are about three versions of this already in the archive, but none of
them is quite right.  This one's a little better; someone sent it to me last
fall, and I recently cleaned it up because I wanted to play it.

Unfortunately, this might still have mistakes; I can't check because I don't
have the album.  I'll have to see if I can get them to play it on the radio...
