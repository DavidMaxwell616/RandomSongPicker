One of my favorites, Stones or otherwise. dj

The following is a faithful representation of how I remember this. It is not
meant to supplant buying the original music, sheet or recorded, and is for 
instructional purposes only. 

Words in parentheses are possible alternatives...
The intro above the first line of the body of the lyric is tabbed in a
corrupt 
v. of Baxtab, which I haven't seen in 20 years. Where is Bob Baxter?
The tab descended from renaissance lute tablature below the body of the lyric

is used to describe same.

Sounds like there could be a 12 string in there.

What    a drag    it       is             get-   ting     old

Things (Kids?) are different today
I hear every mother say
                                         F   D
Mother needs something today to calm her down
           G
And though she's not really ill
          C      C/B    Am
There's a little yellow pill
         Am                            D7
She goes running to the shelter of her Mother's Little Helper
       Em
And it helps her on her way
Gets her through her busy day.



Things are different today
I hear every mother say
Cooking fresh food for her husband's just a drag
So she buys an instant cake 
And she finds a frozen steak
And goes running for the shelter
Of her Mother's Little Helper 
And to help her on her way
Get her through her busy day. 

       C                   D
Doctor please some more of these
            G
Outside the door
              C
She took four more
       Am      (D7)
What a drag it is   getting old. (getting up?)

Things just aren't the same today
I hear every mother say
They just don't appreciate that you get tired
They're so hard to satisfy
You can tranquilize your mind
So go running for the shelter
Of her Mother's Little Helper
And four help you through the night
Help to minimize your plight.

Doctor please some more of these
Outside the door
She's due for more (She took four more?)
What a drag it is getting old. (up?)

Life just much too hard today
I hear every mother say
The pursuit of happiness just seems a bore
And if you take more of those
You will get an overdose

No more running for the shelter
Of her Mother's Little Helper
They just helped you on your way
To (to?) your busy dying day.
A!

Apocryphal performance tip addendum: Imagine self singing this 
with a pouty little sneer, in order to help adjust mental attitude to 
snottiness of lyric and accomodate supercilious perspective.
