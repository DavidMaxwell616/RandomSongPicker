      D                          G          C                          F
I've been all around this whole wide world way down in Memphis, Tennessee 
     D               G             C                   F
and any old place I leave my hat, that becomes home to me
D               G                  C               F
When I left my love behind she's standing in the door 
D                             G                                  
She throwed her little arms around my neck and said, 
  C                        F
"Sweet Daddy please don't go"


D                      G      C                      F
Don't let your deal go down, don't let your deal go down,
D                       G                       C                      F
don't let your deal go down pretty mama 'til my last doggone dollar's spent


D                      G                   C                      F
Whose gonna shoe your pretty little feet whose gonna glove your hand, 
D                      G           C                   F
whose gonna kiss these ruby lips, whose gonna be your man?
D                      G               C                   F
"Papa will shoe my pretty little feet, mama will glove my hand,
D               G          C                  F
you can kiss my rosy lips when you get back again"

(Chorus)

D                      G                        C                  F
Where did you get them high heel shoes and that dress you wear so fine?
D                      G                 C                          F
Got my shoes from a railroad man and my dress from a driver in the mine

(chorus)
