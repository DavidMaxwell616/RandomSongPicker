 E                           D
Annie's twelve years old in two more she'll be a whore  
Nobody ever told her it's the   wrong way  
Don't be afraid with the        quickness you get laid for your  
Family get paid it's the        wrong way
A                       G
I gave her all that I   had to give 
I'm gonna make it       hard to live  
Big salty tears running down her chin and it
A                   C
Ruins up her makeup I never wanted
   F#                           E
A cigarette                  pressed between her lips as I’m 
Staring at her tits it's the wrong way  
Strong if I can but I        am only a man so I 
Take her to the can it's the wrong way
B                            A
The only family that         she’s ever had is her
Seven horny brothers and her drunk-ass Dad
He needed money so he        put her on the street
B                          D
Everything was going fine until the day she met me
E                                     D
Happy are you sad                    wanna shoot your Dad I’ll do
Anything I can                       the wrong way
We talked all night                  tried to make it right
Believe me shit was tight it was the wrong way
A                   G 
Go run away if you don’t wanna stay cause I
Ain’t here to make ya              oh no
It’s up to you what you  really wanna do
A                            C
Spend some time in America  dub-style
F#                    E
(horn solo, minimal guitar, play 4x)
B                           A
She’ll give you all that she’s got to give but
I'm gonna make it              hard to live  
Big salty tears rolling        down to her chin and it
B                      D
Smears up her makeup I never wanted
E                              D
So we ran away and I'm         sorry when I say that straight 
To this very day it was the    wrong way 
She took a hike                don't matter if I like it or 
Not because she only wants the wrong way
B                              A
I gave her all that I          had to give but she 
Still wouldn't take it                oh no 
Her two brown eyes are leaking like a sieve and it
B                           D
Still ruins her makeup I never wanted...
