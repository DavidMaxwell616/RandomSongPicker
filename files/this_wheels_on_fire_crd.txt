THIS WHEEL'S ON FIRE- Bob Dylan and The Band

          Am
If your memory serves you well
                  Bo7
We were goin' to meet again and wait
         E
So I'm goin to unpack all my things
    Dm    F                 Am
And sit before it gets too late
  C                Am
No man alive will come to you
      C               Am
With another tale to tell
          C                 Am
But you know that we shall meet again
          Dm     F         Am
If your memory serves you well

CHORUS: 
Dm               F       C              G  G7
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road 
      C   G      F      C
Best notify my next of kin
 F          G       A
This wheel shall explode!

If your memory serves you well
I was goin' to confiscate your lace
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot 
And hide it in your case
If I knew for sure that it was yours
But it was oh so hard to tell
But you knew that we would meet again
If your memory serves you well ...CHORUS

If your memory serves you well
You'll remember you're the one
That called on me to call on them
To get you your favors done
And after every plan had failed
And there was nothing more to tell
You knew that we would meet again
If your memory served you well ...CHORUS
