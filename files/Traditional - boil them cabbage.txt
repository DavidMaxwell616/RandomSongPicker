           Went up on a mountain top gave my horn a blow
           Thought I heard my true love say, "Yonder comes my beau"
           
           CHORUS: Boil them cabbage down boys turn that hoecake round round
           The only song that I can sing is boil them cabbage down
           
           Possum in a simmon tree raccoon on the ground
           Raccoon says "You sun of a gun, shake some simmons down"
           
           Once I had an old gray mule his name was Simon Slick
           He’d roll his ears and back his eyes and how that mule would kick
           
           How that mule would kick he kicked with his dying breath
           He shoved his hind feet down his throat and kicked himself to death
           
           Took my gal to the blacksmith shop to have her mouth made small
           She turned around a time or two and swallowed shop and all
           
           Someone stole my old coon dog wish they’d bring him back
           he chased the big hogs through the fence and the little ones through the crack
           
           Met a possum on the road blind as he could be
           Jumped the fence and whipped my dog and bristled up at me
           
           I’d heard some folks tell there’s gold in them thar hills
           But I’ve lived up there forty years and all I seen was stills
           
           There’s gold in them thar hills I know it for the truth
           For my gal fell down up there and lost her new front tooth
           
           Once I had a rooster he used to crow all day
           Then along came a hurricane and blew the rooster away
