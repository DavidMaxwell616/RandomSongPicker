Ride :: Vines
 
Genre: Rock/Metal

That's the start the middle and the end 
Aren't you glad the universe pretends 
If I don't get this message home 
Once again I'm gunna hate alone 

Ride with me 
Ride with me 
Ride with me Home
Ride with me 
Ride with me 
Ride with me Home

Bought a lot ignored the right to be 
Invite me down because we like to see 
The colours through your loaded mind 
Love the world and liberate our time 

Ride with me 
Ride with me 
Ride with me 
Ride with me 
Ride with me 
Ride with me 

I'm not living a long life 
I'm not waiting alone 

Ride with me 
Ride with me 
Ride with me 
Ride with me 
Ride with me
