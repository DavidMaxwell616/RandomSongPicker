D
Yellow bird,
     G              D
Up high in banana tree,
D
Yellow bird,
     G                  D
You sit all alone like me

G
Did your lady frien',
D
Leave de nest again?
A
Dat is very sad,
D
Make me feel so bad,
G
You can fly away,
D
In the sky away,
A                      D
You're more lucky dan me.

D               G 
I also have a pretty gal,
A                 D
She not with me today,
D
Dey all de same
           G
De pretty gal,
D
Make dem de nest,
A             D
Den dey fly away.

CHORUS

Wish dat I were a yellow bird,
I fly away wid you,
But I am not a yellow bird,
So here I sit,
Nothin' else to do.

CHORUS

Let her fly away,
On de sky away,
Picker coming soon,
Pick from night to noon,
Black and yellow you,
Like banana too,
He might pick you someday.

CHORUS
