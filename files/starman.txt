Starman - David Bowie

Intro:
C G C G
Hey now now

Verse 1
Am
Didn't know what time it was, lights were low oh oh
G
I leaned back on my radio oh oh
D                              D7                               G A# C 
Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll, lotta' soul, he said.
Am
Then the loud sound did seem to fade.
G
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase.
D                             D7            B A
That weren't no DJ. That was hazy cosmic jive.

Chorus
           G       Em
There's a starman waiting in the sky
      Bm              Bm/A
He'd like to come and meet us, 
D                             D7
But he thinks he'd blow our minds.
            G       Em
There's a starman, waiting in the sky.
      Bm            Bm/A
He's told us not to blow it 
          D                  D7
Cause he knows it's all worthwhile.
            C        Cm
He told me let the children lose it.
G          E
Let the children use it.
Am             D
Let all the children boogie.

Verse 2
Am 
I had to phone someone, so I picked on you.
G 
Hey, that's far out so you heard him too.
D                        D7                     G A# C
Switch on the TV we may pick him up on Channel Two.
Am
Look out your window I can see his light.
G
If we can sparkle he may land tonight.
 D                              D7                   B          A
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright.
