Babe, It Ain’t No Lie   C F C G
C-2X G7 C E7 Am F C G7 C

One old woman, Lord in this town keeps telling her lies on me
Wish to my soul that old woman would die keeps telling her lies on me

>Oh babe, it ain’t no lie. Oh babe it ain’t no lie 
You know this life I’m livin’ is very high

Been all around this whole wide world Lord and I just got back today
Work all the week and I give it all to you, honey baby what more can I do?

It Takes A Worried Man - G C G D7 G
(It takes a worried man to sing a worried song)3X 
I’m worried now but I won’t be worried long
(I went across the river and I lay down to sleep)3X
When I awoke I had shackles on my feet
(Ninety-nine links of chain around my feet)3X
And on each link an initial of my name
(I asked the what’s gonna be my fine)3X
Ninety-nine years on the Rocky Mountain Line
