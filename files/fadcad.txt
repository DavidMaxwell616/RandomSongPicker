FAD CAD

something that twists inside of you 
something that made you wear through 
a mystery that makes you burn 
a secret that no one wants to learn 
you left me with my jaded thoughts 
still faded from my threadbare heart

F#                 
drowned my pain immersed my brain
     A               C7
and fell completely apart
F#                 
the days are cold I languish on 
A                  C7
until the evening falls
F#                 
in the haze and lazy complacency
     A                 C7          
of purgatory shopping malls

now I embrace the gloom and doom 
at noon in my empty living room 
and soon your swoon will ruin your womb 
and your tune will impune like an open wound in june

and when you fall into the hole your digging 
I will remember all the reasons you’ll never be forgiven
sick of looking round for someone new 
I can’t remember whatever became of you

surrounded by friends I still feel all alone
                 
dragged off to another wedding 
yet another one I won’t be getting
