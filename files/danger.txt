DANGEROUS TYPE

A
Can I touch you, are you out of touch
I guess I never noticed that much
Geranium lover, I'm live on your wire
Come and take me whoever you are

CHORUS

Dm A#

C                G
She's a lot like you
               Dm   A#   
The dangerous type
         C           G
She's a lot like you
                    A
Come on and hold me tight

Inside angel, always upset
Keep on forgetting that we ever met
Can I bring you out in the light
My curiosity's got me tonight

CHORUS
The museum directors with their high shaking heads
They kick white shadows until they play dead
They want to crack your crosswoird smile
Can I take you out for awhile
