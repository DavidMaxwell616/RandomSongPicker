Subject: CRD: I don't like mondays by the boomtown rats

All right, I have tried to find out the chords to I don't like mondays 
by the Boomtown Rats. I do not claim these are the right ones, but they 
come pretty close (I put the chords in the song by listening to the 
tape, so there might be one or two wrong ones). The only thing is that 
in the original song, it seems that all is tuned 3/4 notes lower, but 
I've searched for not-to-difficult-to-play chords.
I got the text from listening to the tape, so there also might be some 
slight mistakes in it.

I DON'T LIKE MONDAYS - THE BOOMTOWN RATS
----------------------------------------

    C              G
The silicon chip inside her head 

     F               G
Gets switched to overload

    C                    G
And nobody's gonna go to school today,

            F                 G
She's gonna make them stay at home,

    Am                 G
And daddy doesn't understand it,

          C                    F
He always said she was good as gold,

           F
And he can see no reasons

          F
Cos there are no reasons

     F                        G
What reason do you need to be shown


        C                G
Tell me why I don't like mondays,

        F                G
Tell me why I don't like mondays,

        C                G
Tell me why I don't like mondays,

        F                    G
I wanna shoo-oo-oo-oo - oo - oot

NC            C
The whole day down.


    C                G
The Telex machine is kept so clean

       F                  G
And it types to a waiting world,

    C
And Mother feels so shocked

         G
Father's world is rocked,

          F
And their thoughts turn to

      G
Their own little girl.

Am                       G
Sweet sixteen ain't that peachy keen,

       C                  F
No, it ain't so neat to admit defeat,

         F
They can see no reasons

          F
Cos there are no reasons

     F              G
What reasons do you need


        C                G
Tell me why I don't like mondays

        F                G
Tell me why I don't like mondays

        C                G
Tell me why I don't like mondays

        F                    G
I wanna shoo-oo-oo-oo - oo - oot

NC            Am                             F
The whole day down, down, down, shoot it all down...


            C                        G
And all the playing's stopped in the playground now

    F                      G
She wants to play with her toys a while,

    C                      G
And school's out early and soon we'll be learning

        F               G
And the lesson today is how to die.

             Am
And then the bullhorn crackles,

        G
And the captain tackles,

         C                          F
With the problems and the how's and why's

           F
And he can see no reasons

          F
Cos there are no reasons

     F                     G
what reason do you need to die


        C                G
Tell me why I don't like mondays

        F                G
Tell me why I don't like mondays

        C                G
Tell me why I don't like mondays

        F                    G
I wanna shoo-oo-oo-oo - oo - oot

NC            C
The whole day down.


Since the original is played on piano, chances are that you won't like 
it as much on guitar, but I think it sounds reasonably well.

Richard.
