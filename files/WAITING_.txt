Am              F            G                   C
Watchin girls a-passin' by   It ain't the latest thing
G                      C        G                            C
I'm just standin' in a doorway  I'm just tryin' to make some sense
Am                   F                G                   C
out of these girls a-passin' by...the tales they tell of men
G                      C        G                     C
I'm not waitin' on a lady       I'm just waiting on a friend
Am                   F                     G               C
A smile relieves the heart that bleeds     remember what I said

G                    C      G                     C
I'm not waitin' on a lady   I'm just waiting on a friend



Csus2  Dm F {repeat, sax solo followed by ad lib-ish "doo doo"}

(repeat "I'm just waiting on a friend" on F)



Am                   F                     G                   C
Don't need a whore I don't need no booze - don't need a virgin priest

G                        C         G                 C
But I need someone I can cry to    I need someone to protect

Am             F                G                C                      
Makin love and breakin hearts - it is a game for youth

G                        C      G                    C
but I'm not waiting on a lady...I'm just waitin on a friend



Csus2  Dm F {repeat, more sax solo followed by ad lib "doo doo"}

(just waitin on a friend)
