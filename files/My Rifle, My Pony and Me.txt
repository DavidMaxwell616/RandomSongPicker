Rick Nelson Lyrics - My Rifle, My Pony and Me 


            My Rifle Pony and Me 
            Duet w/ Dean Martin Previously Unreleased 
            Sun is sinking in the west 
            The cattle go down to the stream 
            The redwing settles in the nest 
            It's time for a cowboy to dream 
            Purple light in the canyon 
            that is where I long to be 
            With my three good companions 
            just my rifle pony and me 
            Gonna hang my sombrero 
            on the limb of a tree 
            Coming home sweet my darling 
            just my rifle pony and me 
            Whippoorwill in the willow 
            sings a sweet melody 
            Riding to Amarillo 
            just my rifle pony and me 
            No more cows to be ropin' 
            No more strays will I see 
            'round the bend shell be waitin 
            For my rifle pony and me 
            For my rifle my pony and me
