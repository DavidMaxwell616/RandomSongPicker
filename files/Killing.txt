KILLING IS THE ONLY HONESTY

Killing is the only honesty, better than false smiles of razor edged teeth.

I'd rather have a man put a knife to my neck and slice,

than to buy me a drink, shake my hand as he takes off with my wife.

My life is tortured by forgotten memories, Drunks Against Vodka In Domine, 
that spells DAVID for me every day. 
Mediocre can't get enough while the finest roll on by satisfied 

Pathetic or prophetic I'm blue as I watch the ego world of smarm collapse around you.
Killing is the only life for me 
braincells are targets and I'm  out on a spree. They're all ready to die.

My lungs are roastin' ready and born to ripe The bottle's already started as I load up my pipe
This song flows like the blood from R. Bud Dwyer's nose
Optical nerve dies as the mind it grows

I walk through the streets in obscurity. I don't bother nobody and they don't bother me.
I keep to myself and I live alone. 
Life ain't worth living if you're living for somebody else 
and you ain't livin' your own.
