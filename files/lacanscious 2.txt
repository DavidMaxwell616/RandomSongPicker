LACANSCIOUS SONG 2
             C           F      Am        G
well when I look in the mirror what do I see
i see another little monkey looking back at me
well if that monkey gets stabbed I feel a little bit bad
but it ain't gonna die as long as I'm alive

Em                       D                 
I'm not in the mirror stage right now
Em                          G
I got a genital face and a whole lotta frowns
G                    Em                 D                     A
call me a stupid a motherfucker but I know that it's just a couple of words

mirror stage that is my age I'm about 11:30 going down to the grave

I wish I was a fool who believed in your rules 

but they're just a bunch of other buncha stains and brothers

call me a birdcage and a haircut
I'm a lazy son of a bitch there

Freud says my mom's got big breasts

but he's never seen her in fact he's quite dead

A                                     Em              
30 nazis in my family tree I'm gonna shoot them down with the rifle dad gave me
F                     Em
mom says she's got a vagina too
        G
but I swear I saw something like you
crawling out of those lips sinking those ships
I got a bare wild undulating black girls hips
wish I was a car or a port 
wish I was a drunken shakespearean lord
know what the language of lacan meant
is Lacan excused from his own bullshit
if he a stifle would be made out of trees
fumbling stumbling grumbling down to his knees

lacan shut up your mouth
open books and drown in the south
where david lynch talking froggies like you
french theory is not on my shoe
it's more like eastern zen won-ton soup
dear love and drop a dose too
some shrooms some alistair crowley
some magical news with sexual fountains
lacan why do you wanna fight
ain't nothing wrong with this stupid hippy tonight

alright my mama's got a face like an angel in white
you gotta a lotta loving to give
but she's just a figment of my imagination
there's more to life than unconsciuous
reaching forward, reaching back
I'm gonna have a heartattack

wading through your french theory
all you conversations about freudian nations
obedient sensibility so fucked
all this bullshit theory has got me so fucked up
