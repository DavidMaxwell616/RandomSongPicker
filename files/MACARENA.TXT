This is the version I was taught. It's a little different:

Macarena Translated
------------------------------
 
Bale a tu cuerpo alegria Macarena
Que tu cuerpo es pa' darle alegria y cosa buena
Bale a tu cuerpo alegria Macarena
Ehhh, Macarena!
 
   Dance to shitty music stupid Americans!
   You are so stupid that you think this shitty music is good
   Dance to shitty music stupid Americans
   Heeyyy, stupid Americans!
 
Macarena tiene un novio que se llama
Que se llama de apellido Vitorino
Y en la jura de bandera del muchacho
Se la dio con dos amigos
 
   Stupid americans will have sex with a llama
   Why is the llama named Vitronio?
   While you're busy your girl will go at it with our friends
   and we'll be friends with them (doesn't translate well)
 
Que le gusta la movida guerrilera
Macarena suean con el Corte Ingles
Y se compra los mnodelos mas modernos
Le gustaria vivr on Nueva York
 
   With much force you bugger gorillas
   Stupid Americans buy their clothes at K-Mart
   And they compare their asses with their faces
   We think New York Sucks



 
It's got a great beat. I can dance to it. I'll give it a .357.



If it is any consolation, the real translation goes 
something like...

     Dance (move) your body with happiness Macarena
           Give happiness to your body , Macarena

     Your body is for giving happiness and good things
     Dance (move) your body with happiness Macarena
           Give happiness to your body , Macarena
     Heeeyyy, Macarena!
       Ehhhhhhhhhh, Macarena. Aaaaiiii!
     
     Macarena has a boyfriend who is named
     Whose last name is Vitronio?
                         Vitorino  (Vitorinos are a breed of bull)





     He's a really good guy   (paraphrased)
     He got in a fight with two friends.
