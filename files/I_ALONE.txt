Here's the deal-Live's performance on SNL was great, so I bought the CD,
especially when I heard Lightning Crashes (BTW, all it is is F,C,G 1/2
step down with Am thrown in in the middle). Here's what I figured out for
I Alone. 


I ALONE by Live
Lyrics by edward kowalcyyk,
music by live

GUITARS ARE ALL ONE-HALF STEP DOWN

G        D        C          
It's easier not to be wise

G                   D                  C
and measure these things by your brains

G            D           C
I sank into Eden with you

G             D              C      
alone in the church by and by

G                D             C
I'll read to you here, save your eyes

G                           D                C
You'll need them, your boat is at sea

G                     D                    C
your anchor is up, you've been swept away

 G                   D        C          
and the greatest of teachers won't hesitate

B(power chord distorted)
to leave you there, by yourself, chained to fate (yeah..)

E    B            GG    E     B              GG         E        B      GG
  A
I ALONE love you I ALONE tempt you  I ALONE love you


A(repeat)
fear is not the end, yeah....


It's easier not to be great
and measure these things in your eyes
I've long to be here by his resolve
alone in the church by and by
to cradle the baby in space
and leave you here by yourself, chained to fate

(B power chord implied throughout, rings as needed)
(oh, now we took it back too far,
and love can save now, all these riddles that you burn
all come runnin' back to you, all these rhythms that you hide
only love can save us now, all these riddle that you burn
yeah, yeah, yeah....)

=====>Anyway, the lyrics are from the CD, so they're right. As for the
chords, hey, no guarantees, folks. Hope it's close, and I think it is.

Here's Lightning Crashes lyrics
(REMEMBER, F,C,G for verse and chorus except for Am thrown in in middle)
Lightning Crashes, a new mother cries
her placenta falls to the floor
the angel opens her eyes
the confusion sets in
before the doctor can even close the door

Lightning Crashes, an old mother dies
her intentions fall to the floor
the angel closes her eyes
the confusion that was hers
belongs now to the baby down the hall

Oh, now feel it coming back again 
like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
forces pullin' from the center of the earth again
I can feel it

Lightening Crashes, a new mother cries
this moment she's been waiting for
the angel opens her eyes
Pale blue colored iris presents the circle
and puts the glory out to hide, hide...

BTW, any Rage songs not already posted woule be greatly appreciated.
