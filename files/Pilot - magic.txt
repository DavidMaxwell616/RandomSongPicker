PILOT lyrics - "Magic" 

G  Bm Em A C D G   F9!

G 
Ho, ho, ho
      Bm7        Am
It's magic, you know
D7                      G
Never believe it's not so
      Bm7        Am
It's magic, you know
 D7                     Cm  G   F9!
Never believe, it's not so

G
Never been awake
Bm                Em      
Never seen a day break
A                            C   D
Leaning on my pillow in the morning
G
Lazy day in bed
Bm           Em
Music in my head
A                          C   D    G
Crazy music playing in the morning light

Ho, ho, ho
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so

I love my sunny day
Dream of far away
Dreaming on my pillow in the morning
Never been awake
Never seen a day break
Leaning on my pillow in the morning light

Ho, ho, ho
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so

[Musical Interlude]

Ho, ho, ho
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so
