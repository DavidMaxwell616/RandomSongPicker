Note: I had the pleasure of meeting Jimmy Carl Black and Don Preston in San Francisco this fall. 
JCB smelt like a whiskey barrel and Don Preston looks better now at 69 than he did when he was 
in the Mothers! Both were very friendly and talked openly of their Zappa days.

Intro: C

C                                Bb      (repeat)
My name is Burtram, I am a redneck, All my friends, they call me 'Burt' (Hi, Burt!)
All my family, from down in Texas, Make their livin' diggin' dirt 
Come out here to Californy, just to find me some pretty girls 
ones I seen gets me so horny; ruby lips, 'n teeth like pearls! 
Wanna love 'em all! Wanna love 'em dearly! 
Wanna pretty girl—I'll even pay!
I'll buy 'em furs! I'll buy 'em jewelry! 
I know they like me; Here's what I say:

(Chorus)
E                                   A   (repeat)
I'm lonesome Cowboy Burt! (Speakin' atcha!), 
Come smell my fringe-y shirt! (Reekin' atcha!) 
My cowboy pants, my cowboy dance,                                   D            E
My bold advance, on this here waitress . . .
D                                      A                   E                       A       A7

When I get off, I get plastered drink till I fall onna floor,
Find me some Communist bastard, ‘n stomp on his face till he don't
Move no more! (He stomps on his face till he don't move no more!) 
I fuss, an' I cuss an' I keep on drinkin', till my eyes puff up an' turn red! 
I drool on m'shirt, I see if he's hurt,
Kick him again in the head, yes! Kick him again in the head, boys!
Kick him again in the head, now! KICK HIM AGAIN IN THE HEAD! 

(Repeat chorus)
OPAL, YOU HOT LITTLE BITCH!
