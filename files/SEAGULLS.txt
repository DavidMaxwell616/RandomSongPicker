E               *F#sus           G          C 
Standing in the hallway of some stranger's house.
E                     F#sus             G          D
The party had started raging when the liquor ran out.
E              F#sus         G            C 
I looked at my buddy and I patted on my chest, 
E                  F#sus                    G              D
cause stashed underneath my coat was some Hiram Walker's Best.
E             F#sus               G                C
Thirsty eyes glared around, the mood soon turned sour.
E              F#sus            G                           D 
Music couldn't hold the pace, and the liquor store's past closing hour.

  Am   F             G      Am     F        G                     
  As I busted out my flask, radars honed in attention stirred fast. 
  F#                        Bm          
  Zombies circled 'round my buzz was their prey.
      A                            B7  
  The seagulls had descended and I could not get away.

For a fleeting moment sweet heaven was mine, all mine,
whiskey eased my thoughts amber waves caressed my mind.
My pal and I danced around, funky rhythms drove us on.
Indiscretion on my part and our cover was blown.
Fugitive pied pipers of parasitic boozehounds.
"Please just one shot, Max, tomorrow I'm getting an ounce"

Chorus

Making temporary friends we were a Godsend to those folks
now friendlier, their stomachs warm, the girls lit up their smokes.  
Buzzes around us began to drain the lives of ours. 
My flask went bone dry, they all left within half an hour. 
Soon we both headed home, my friend's spirits were glum,
until I reminded him of the gallon at home from which the flask had come. 

So when you all go out to rage, 
drink for yourself and act your age. 
Drinking for the moment will leave you dry at the end of the night, 
and when the seagulls descend, you cannot put up a fight.
