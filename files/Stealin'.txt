Stealin’ - C C7 F Fm (C G C G C F C)2X C C7 F Fm C G C

Put your arms around me like a circle round the sun 
I wanna love you rider like an easy rider does 

you don’t believe I love you look what a hole I’m in. 
You don’t believe I’m sinking look what a hole I’m in. 
Stealin’ Stealin’ pretty mama don’t you tell on me. 
‘Cause I’m stealin’ back to my same old used to be. 

The woman I love she’s so far away 
and the woman I hate I see her every damn day

The woman I love she’s just about my size. 
She’s a married woman come to see me tonight
