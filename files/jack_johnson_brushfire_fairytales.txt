           F#  
Brushfire fairytales 
            B
Itsy bitsy diamond wells 
         F#
Big fat hurricanes 
                B
Yellow bellied given names 
                     C#
Well shortcuts can slow you down 
             B
And in the end we're bound 
                  F#
To rebound off of we 

C#

                    F#
Well dust off your thinking caps 
               B
Solar powered plastic plants 
                     F#
Pretty pictures of things we ate 
             B
We are only what we hate 
                 C#
But in the long run we have found 
                   B
Silent films are full of sound 
           F#
Inaudibly free 

C# 

F#
Slow down everyone 
        A#
You're moving too fast 
B
Frames can't catch you when 
G#
You're moving like that 

F#
Inaudible melodies 
          A#
Serve narrational strategies 
B   
Unobtrusive tones 
          C#
Help to notice nothing but the zone 
     F#
Of visual relevancy 
 A#
Frame-lines tell me what to see 
B
Chopping like an axe 
          G#
Or maybe Eisenstein should just relax 

F#
Slow down everyone 
        A#
You're moving too fast 
B
Frames can't catch you when 
G#
You're moving like that 

(solo)

(continue chorus chords)
Well Plato's cave is full of freaks 
Demanding refunds for the things they've seen 
I wish they could believe 
In all the things that never made the screen 
And just slow down everyone 
You're moving too fast 
Frames can't catch you when 
You're moving like that 
Slow down everyone 
You're moving too fast 
Frames can't catch you when 
You're moving like that 
Moving Too....

INTRO
Em   A (2x)

      Em
Well he's not necessarily trying to say that he minds it 
      A
But someone plays evil tricks on that kid 
      Em
Well he's not necessarily trying to say god can't be trusted 
      A
But someone plays evil tricks on that kid 
     Em
And certain situations scream for deviations 
      A
But somehow he always gets stuck in the middle 
    Em
Of this and that and man he should try less 
    A
Because every time he's rejected man he loses affection 
     C  
But don't we all, don't we just got to give a little time 
       A                     D
Maybe give a friend a call instead of making him 

Em       D  
confused 
A                D                Em  D
What a terrible thing for you to do 
A                D                Em  D
What an awful thing for you to say 
A                D                  A  G F# F 
What a terrible thing for you to relay 

Well I know some people's they got a little less than nothing 
But still find some to spare 
And other people got more than they could use 
But they don't share 
And some people got problems man 
They got awful complications 
Other people got perfect situations 
With no provocation 

But don't we all, don't we just got to give a little time 
Maybe give a friend a call instead of making him 

confused 
What a terrible thing for you to do 
What an awful thing for you to say 
What a terrible thing for you 
Confused 
What a terrible thing for you to do 
What an awful thing for you to say 
What a terrible thing for you to relay 

Somehow we always get stuck in the middle 
Confused, what an awful thing for you to do 
Confused, what an awful thing for you to say

 E5                           E5/B      
Looking at himself but wishing he was someone else 
             E5/C#                         E5/B
Because the posters on the wall they don't look like him at all 

       E5                           E5/B      
So he ties it up, he tucks it in, he pulls it back, and gives a grin 
 E5/C#                                        E5/B
Laughing at himself because he knows he ain't loved at all 

A
He gets his courage from the can, 
It makes him feel like a man 
               B
Because he's loving all the ladies 
But the ladies don't love him at all 

E5 E5/B E5/C# E5/B

A
Cause when he's not drunk 
He's only stuck on himself 
B
And then he has the nerve 
To say he needs a decent girl 

Looking at herself but wishing she was someone else 
Because the body of the doll it don't look like hers at all 

So she straps it on, she sucks it in, she throws it up, and gives a grin 
Laughing at herself because she knows she ain't that at all 

All caught up in the trends 
Well the truth began to bend 
And the next thing you know man 
There just ain't no truth left at all 

Cause when the pretty girl walks 
She walks so proud 
And when the pretty girl laughs 
Oh man, she laughs so loud 

    E                           D
And if it ain't this then its that 
                G#m7
As a matter of fact 
                  B
She hasn't had a day to relax 
E               D       C#m7       B
Since she has lost her ability to think clearly 

Well I'm an energetic hypothetic version of another person 
Check out my outsides there ain't nothing in here 

Well I'm a superficial, systematic, music television addict 
Check out my outsides there ain't nothing in 

Here comes another one, just like the other one 
Looking at himself but wishing he was someone else 
Because the posters on the wall they don't look like a him 
And so he ties it up he tucks it in, he pulls it back and gives a grin 
Laughing at himself because he knows he ain't loved at all 
He knows he ain't loved at all

Sexy sexy made up of plexi disasters 
F#
Pushing and pulling conservative rolling 
Bm
Unlike plastic, easier to see through 
F#
Just like glass with no ring

You're breaking your mind 
G                         F#
By killing the time that kills you 
Bm                        A
But you can't blame the time 
G                      F#   Bm
When its only in your mind 

Quickly quickly grow and then you'll know 
It is such and awkward show to see 
And everyone you wanted to know 
And everyone you wanted to meet 
Have all gone away 
Well they've all gone away 

And now you're 
Breaking your mind 
By killing the time that kills you 
But you cant blame the time 
When its only in your mind 

Bm      
You're breaking your mind
Bm      
You're breaking your mind

5. FLAKE


Dm                     F
I know she said it's alright 
     Bb                      F
But you can make it up next time 
Dm                     F
I know she knows it's not right 
       Bb              F
There ain't no use in lying 
 Dm                  F
Maybe she thinks I know something 
       Bb                          F
Maybe maybe she thinks its fine 
Dm                    F
Maybe she knows something I don't 
         Bb              C5
I'm so, I'm so tired, I'm so tired of trying 

CHORUS

     F               C5
It seems to me that maybe, 
Dm                           A
It pretty much always means no 
     Bb               C5               F     C
So don't tell me you might just let it go 
     F                 C
And often times we're lazy 
     Dm                  A
It seems to stand in my way 
      Bb                 C5 

Cause no one no not no one 
                   F     C
Likes to be let down 

I know she loves the sunrise 
No longer sees it with her sleeping eyes 
And I know that when she said she's gonna try 
Well it might not work because of other ties and 
I know she usually has some other ties 
And I wouldn't want to break 'em, nah, 
I wouldn't want to break 'em 
Maybe she'll help me to untie this but 
Until then well, I'm gonna have to lie too

It's as simple as something that nobody knows that her 
E5                      C5
eyes are as big as her bubbly toes 
        D5                     A5
on the feet of a queen of the hearts of the cards 
         E5                        C5             G5 G G6 G G7
and her feet are all covered with tar balls and scars 

It's as common as something that nobody knows that her beauty will 
follow wherever she goes 
up the hill in the back of her house in the would she love me forever, 
I know she could 

I remember when you and me mmm how we used to be just good friends 
Wouldn't give me none 
But all I wanted was some

G  C D
 
G
She's got a whole lot of reasons 
                      C
She cant think of a single one 
           D
That can justify leaving 
            G                                    C
and he got none but he thinks he got so many problems 
                              D
Man he got, too much time to waste 

His dreams are like commercials 
But her dreams are picture perfect and 
Our dreams are so related though they're often underestimated

La da da da da da 

Well I was eating lunch at the D. L. G. 
When this little girl came and she sat next to me 
I never seen nobody move the way she did 
Well she did and she does and she'll do it again 

When you move like a jellyfish 
Rhythm don't mean nothing 
You go with the flow 
You don't stop 
Move like a jellyfish 
Rhythm is nothing 
You go with the flow 
You don't stop 

It's as common as something that nobody knows it 
Her beauty will follow wherever she goes 
Up the hill in the back of her house in the wood 
She'll love me forever, I know she 

If you would only listen 
You might just realize what you're missing 
You're missing me 
If you would only listen 
You might just realize what you're missing 
You're missing me 

It's as simple as something that nobody knows that 
Her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes 
On the feet of the queen of the hearts of the cards 
And her feet are infested with tar balls and

On the news tonight 

Who's the one to decide that it would be alright 
To put the music behind the news tonight 
Well mama said 
You can't believe everything you hear 
The diagetic world is so unclear 
So baby close your ears

Why don't the newscasters cry when they read about people who die? 
At least they could be decent enough to put just a tear in their eyes 
Mama said 
It's just make believe 
You cant believe everything you see 
So baby close your eyes to the lullabies

Drink the water drink it down 
This time I know I'm bound 
A7
To spit it back up

I didn't want this

Salty substitute, just not going to do

I need some air, if I'm going to live through

This experience reminds me of a clock 
A7
That just won't tick 
G7
I want to wake up 

>From this concussion 
But my dream is just not done 
I'm late again, 
It's just one of those 
Bad days look outside and 
Be careful what you ride 
You just might find

That you're out of time 
A          Dm
To swim ashore

He's got delusions between his ears 
Man it takes up too much space 
And all that tension between his gears man 
He'll never ever leave this place 
He's got stones instead of bones 
And everybody knows 
That can make you real real slow 
And if heaven was below 
He'd know just where to go 
Dive in the ocean 
And he'd sink like a stone 
And he'd say 
It's time to swim ashore 
If I drift long enough 
I'll be home 

Hold on if you can 
You're gonna sink faster 
Than you can imagine so hold 
Hold on if you can 
You're gonna sink faster 
Than you can imagine so hold 

It's just time to swim ashore 
If I drift long enough 
I'll be home

G
Saturday morning and it's time to go 
One day these could be the days but who could have known 
D7
Loading in the back of a pickup truck 
Riding with the boys and pushing the luck 
G
Singing songs loud on the way to the game 
Wishing all the things could still be the same 
D7
Chinese homeruns over the backstop 
Kakua on the ball and soda pop well... 

Em7                 Am7
We used to laugh a lot 
     C               
But only because we thought 
         G              D7
That everything good always would remain 
  G                                D7       G        D7
Nothing's gonna change there's no need to complain 

Sunday morning and it's time to go 
Been raining all night so everybody knows 
Over to the field for tackle football 
Big hits, big hats, yeah give me the ball 
Rain is pouring, touchdown scoring 
Keep on rolling, never boring 
Karma, karma, karma chameleon 
We're talking kinda funny from helium 

We used to laugh a lot 
But only because we thought 
That everything good always would remain 
Nothing's gonna change there's no need to complain

Monday morning and it's time to go 
Wet trunks and schoolbooks and sand on my toes 
Do anything you can to dodge the bus-stop blues 
Like driving a padiddle with a burnt-out fuse 
My best friend Kimi wants to go with you 
So meet her by the sugar mill after school 
My best friend Kimi wants to go with you 
Meet her by the sugar mill after school 

We used to laugh a lot 
But only because we thought 
That everything good always would remain 
We used to laugh a lot 
But only because we thought

E                  B5
Hermit crabs and cowry shells 
       A6
Crush beneath his feet as he comes towards you 
He's waving at you 

Lift him up to see what you can see 
He begins his focusing 
He's aiming at you 

And now he has cutaways from memories 
And close-ups of anything that 
He has seen or even dreamed 
And now he's finished focusing 

He's imagining lightning 
Striking sea sickness 
Away from here 

E6                   G# m7     A6    B
Look who's laughing now that you've wasted 
E6                   G# m7   A6    B
How many years and you've barely even tasted 
Anything remotely close to 
Everything you've boasted about 
Look who's crying now 

Driftwood floats, after years of erosion 
Incoming tide touches roots to expose them, 
Quicksand steals my shoe, 
Clouds bring the f-stop blues 

Look who's laughing now that you've wasted 
How many years and you've barely even tasted 
Anything remotely close to 
Everything you've boasted about 
Look who's crying now

         Am
I got a faulty parachute 
          C           G5
I got a stranger's friend 
    Am 
An exciting change in 
     C       G5
My butchers blend 
  Am 
A symbol on the ceiling 
          C          G5
With the flick of a switch 
   Am 
My new found hero 
         C         G5
In the enemy's ditching 

F

Well somebody's something was left in the room 
And man, now that its gone well of course we assume 
That somebody else needed something so bad 
That they took everything that somebody had 

C       G/B     Am
Losing hope is easy 
D                G
When your only friend is gone 
      D                   G
And every time you look around 
D                           G         C
Well, it all, it all just seems to change 

The mark was left 
Man it's never the same 
Next time that you shoot 
Make sure that you aim 
Open windows with passing cars 
A brand new night 
With the same old stars 

Losing hope is easy 
When your only friend is gone 
And every time you look around 
Well, it all, it all just seems to change 

Feed the fool 
A piece of the pie 
Make a fool of his system 
Make a fool of his mind 
Give him bottles of lies 
And maybe he'll find 
His place in heaven 
Cause he might just die 

Losing hope is easy 
When your only friend is gone 
And every time you look around 
Well, it all, it all just seems to change 
But hanging on is easy 
When you've got a friend to call 
When nothings making sense at all 
You're not the only one that's afraid of change

  G                      D
Everyone laughed at her joke
              F#                   Bm
As if they'd never even heard it before
     G                     D
And maybe they were truly amused
     F#                        Bm
But every word she spoke was a bore
      G                          D
And maybe it's because they had seen
     F#                 Bm
The previews on the TV screen
            G                         D
"Well this part is good and that's well understood,
               F#                      Bm
so you should laugh if you know what I mean"

CHORUS

But it's all relative
Even if you don't understand
Well it's all understood
Especially when you don't understand
Then it's all just because
Even if we don't understand
Then let's all just believe

Everyone knows what went down
Because the news was spread all over town
And fact is only what you believe
And fact and fiction work as a team
It's almost always fiction in the end
The content begins to bend
When context is never the same

CHORUS

I was reading a book
Or maybe it was a magazine *
Suggestions on where to place faith
Suggestions on what to believe 
But I read somewhere that you've got to beware
You can't believe anything you read
But the Good Book is good and that's well understood
So don't even question if you know what I mean

CHORUS

But there you go Once again
You missed the point And then you point 
your fingers at me And say that I said not to believe

Ah but there you go once again You missed the point
And then you point your Fingers at me
And you say that I said not to believe 

Well I believe
I believe 
I guess 
I guess it's all relative

A#
nobodys romancing 'cause its too early for dancin
A

bright lights flashing to cover up your lack of so
many people, so many problems, so many reasons
to buy another round, drink it down
just another night on the town

with the big man, money man, better than the other man
he got the plan with the million dollar give a damn
when nobody understands he'll become a smaller man

the disco ball spinning, all the music and the women
the shots of tequila, man they'll say that they need ya,
but what they really need
is just a little room to breathe

teeny bopping disco queen, she barely understands
her dreams of bellybutton rings and other kinds of things
symbolic of change but the thing that is strange
is that the changes occurred...

and now she's just a part of the

herd....yeah, yeah, yeah, man I thought
that you heard...yeah, yeah
the changes occurred, yeah, yeah, yeah, (yeah)
just a part of the herd
	
lights out, shut down, late night, wet ground
you walk by look at him, but he cant look at you, yeah
you might feel pity but he only feels the ground
you understand moods but he only knows let down
by the corner there's another one
reaching out a hand, coming from a broken man, yeah
you try to live but he's done trying
not dead, but definitely dying

with the rest of the clowns.....yeah, yeah
Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmmm...Mmmmm with the rest of the clowns....

sweeping the floors, open up the doors, yeah
turn on the lights, getting ready for tonight
nobody's romancing 'cause its too early for dancing
but here comes the music
