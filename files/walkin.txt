It ain't no joke I'd like to buy the world a toke and teach the world to 
sing in perfect harmony and teach the world to snuff the fires and the 
liers hey I know it's just a song but it's the spice for recipe I know this 
love attack I know it went out but it's back it's just like any fad it 
retracts before impact and just like fashion it's a passion for the with it 
and the hip if ya' got the goods they'll come and buy it just to stay in 
the cliqe

CHORUS-
So don't delay act now supplies are running out allow, if you're still 
alive, six to eight years to arrive and if you follow there maybe tomorrow 
but if the offer is shun you might as well be walkin' on the sun

Twenty-five years age they broke out and they spoke out of depression and 
oppression and together they toked and they folked out on guitars around a 
bon fire just a singin' and a clappin' man what the hell happened?  Some 
were spell bound some were hell bound some they fell down and some got back 
up and fought back against the melt down and their kids are hippie chicks 
are hypocrites because fashion is smashin' the true meaning of it

CHORUS-

It ain't no joke when mama's hankercheif is soaked with her tears because 
her babys life has been revoked the bond is broke up so choke up and focus 
on the close up Mr. Wizard can't perform no God like hocus pocus so don't 
just sit back kick back and watch the world get bush wacked new at ten your 
neighborhood is under attack put away the crack before the crack put you 
away you need to be there when your baby is old enough to relate

CHORUS-
