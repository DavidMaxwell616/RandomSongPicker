                            "Sunny Afternoon"
                              (Ray Davies)

Intro:

        Dm  /C   /B  /Bb  Am   /G   /F  /E       [2X]
        / / / /  / / / /  / / / /  / / / /

Verse 1:

             Dm             C
        The taxman's taken all my dough
             F              C
        And left me in my stately home
        Am      /G   /F    /E    Dm
        Lazin' on a sunny afternoon
                     C
        And I can't sail my yacht
              F           C
        He's taken everything I've got
        Am        /G        /F     /E   Dm
        All I've got's this sunny afternoon

Chorus 1:

        D                                      G
        Save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
                    C7                       F     A
        I got a big fat mama tryin' to break me
              Dm                G7
        And I love to live so pleasantly
         Dm               G7 
        Live this life of luxury
        F            A        Dm  /C  /B  /Bb
        Lazin' on a sunny afternoon
                Am     /G   /F  /E
        In the summertime

Verse 2:

        My girlfriend's run off with my car
        And gone back to her ma and pa
        Tellin' tales of drunkenness and cruelty
        Now I'm sittin' here
        Sippin' at my ice-cooled beer
        All I've got's this sunny afternoon

Chorus 2:

        Help me, help me, help me sail away
        Or give me two good reasons why I oughta stay
        'Cause I love to live so pleasantly
        Live this life of luxury
        Lazin' on a sunny afternoon
        In the summertime

Here's the ending to Sunny Afternoon:
Using a Dm fingering, pluck the B-string once, then the G-string three
times-do this several times while fading out.
