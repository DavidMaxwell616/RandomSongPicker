This one was a pain to figure out since it is tuned way the hell down.
Tuned down one and a half steps to be exact. I have seen him do this live
and he doesn't tune down, so you don't really have to either, but if you
want to play along with One Foot In The Grave, it's kinda neccecary.

Chord Voicings:
C: 0 3 2 0 1 0
E: 0 2 2 1 0 0
A: 0 0 2 2 2 0
F: 1 3 3 2 x x

C                E              A
Your brains went black when she took back her mouth
    C          E        A
and put it out into the sun
    C         E            A
The birds did fly when the heavens all went dry
	C              E         A
And the cigarettes are smokin by themselves

CHORUS
F
She'll do anything
E
She'll do anything
A                              C
She'll do anything to make you feel like an asshole

Call her name, she looks the same as you
question mark stretched across the skin
She dangles carrots, makes you feel embarressed
to be the fool you know you are

(Chorus)
That's basically it!
Later!
JOHN
