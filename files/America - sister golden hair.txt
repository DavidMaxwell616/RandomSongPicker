this is one of the songs that taught me to sing and play
at the same time.  it's also neat cause it uses all the
major and minor chords in the key of E, so you can instantly
know all the chords of any key by recognizing these patterns

C#min - A - E - Esus4 - E
F#min - C#min - B - A

v1:
         E                             G#min
"well i tried to make it sunday but i got so damned depressed
        A                E               G#min
that i set my sights on monday and i got myself undressed,
        A               F#min         C#min G#min A
i ain't ready for the alter, but i do believe there's times
        F#min         A                E - Esus2 - E
when a woman sure can be a friend of mine"

v2 chords same as first:
         E                             G#min
"well i keep on thinkin bout you sister golden hair surprise
        A                E               G#min
that i just can't live without you can't you see it in my eyes
        A               F#min         C#min G#min A
i've been one poor correspondent, i've been too too hard to find
        F#min         A                E - Esus2 - E
but it doesn't mean you ain't been on my mind"

ch:
           B                             A              E
will you meet me in the middle will you meet me in the end
           B                             A              E
will you love me just a little just enough to show you care
          F#min                  G#min           A
well i tried to fake it i don't mind sayin i just can't make it

repeat intro, then verse 2, then chorus, then they do this
ugly doo wap thing that uses the chorus (B - A - E) thing, that
i always leave out.


there ya go! :)
