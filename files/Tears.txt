Tears In Heaven (Eric Clapton)

Verse:
 A       E/G#    F#m     D/F#  A          E7     
Would you know my name   if I saw you in Heaven
 A       E/G#    F#m  D/F#   A         E7     
Would it be the same  if I saw you in Heaven

 F#m        C#/F   A7       F#7   
  I must be strong  and carry on
       Bm               D/E          A 
Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven

Would you hold my hand, if I saw you in heaven
Would you help me stand, if I saw you in heaven
I'll find my way through night and day
`Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven.


Bridge:
 C       G/B      Am               D/F#         G   D  Em   D G 
Time can bring you down   Time can bend your knees

 C       G/B      Am                D/D#       G       D    E    
Time can break your heart  Have you beggin  please beggin please
