I forgot to mention in my last e-mail the Hendrix song I'd like 
to see tabbed out more than any, Voodoo Child (the more bluesy 
one not the slight return), I think this was Hendrix's best bit 
of blues playing ever.  I know that the song would be an epic 
pain in the ass to tab out concidering how long it is and 
everything, but it really does need to be tabbed.  Thanks

I'd like to see a tab for the lead guitar portion of "1983....", a 
full tab for "House Burning Down" and "51st Anniversary".  If you'd 
tab these out that'd be really cool.  thanks.
