Ah caught you smiling at me that's the way it should be
like a leaf is to a tree so fine.

Ah all the good times we had I sang love songs so glad 
always smiling never sad so fine

As we walk down a country lane I'll be singing a song
hear me calling your name. Hear the wind whisper in 
the trees telling Mother Nature 'bout you and me

Well if the sun shines so bright or our way is darkest
night the road we choose is always right so fine.

Ah can your love be so strong when so many loves go wrong
will our love go on and on and on and on and on and on?

My my la dee da come on now it ain't too far tell all your
friends all around the world ain't no companion like
a blue eyed girl.

Come on now well let me tell you what your missing 'round
them brick walls

So of one thing I am sure it's a friendship so pure angels
singing all around my door so fine.

Yeah ain't but one thing to do spend my natural life with 
you, you're the finest girl I knew so fine.

When you're old and your eyes are dim there ain't no old
shit gonna happen again.

We'll still go walking down country lanes I'll sing the 
same old songs, hear me call your name.
