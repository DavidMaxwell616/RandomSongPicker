Crazy Chords by Gnarls Barkley, www.Ultimate-Guitar.Com

this song is awesome, and this sounds great on acoustic.
(the G(7) are in brackets because i cant decide which sounds better so just make your 
mind up)

(intro: just hit the 3rd fret on the A string)

Cm                                                     Eb
I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
                                           Ab
There was something so pleasant about that phase.

Even your emotions had an echo
           Gm   G(7)
In so much space
Cm
And when you're out there, without care,
                   Eb
Yeah, I was out of touch
                                    Ab
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
                Gm  G(7)
I just knew too much

                  Cm
Does that make me cra-zy
                  Eb
Does that make me cra-zy
                  Ab
Does that make me cra-zy
     Gm G(7)
Probably

(this verse pattern for the second verse is the same as the third verse, but different 
the first)

Cm                                              Ab
And I hope that you are having the time of your life
          Eb                    Gm    G(7)
But think twice, that's my only advice
Cm                                                                    Eb
Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you, who do you think you are,
                    Ab
Ha ha ha bless your soul
                           Gm     G(7)
You really think you're in control

(i'm pretty sure the choruses are the same throughout and the verses follow that last pattern)

Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb
And all I remember is thinking, I want to be like them
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably

(for outro repeat second chorus pattern and end on Cm. have fun with this, and email any 
to me at ilovebeer32@hotmail.com. howlie)
