riff 2x

Jenny said when she was five years old you know her
parents will be the death of us all.
Two TV sets and two Cadillac cars well they don't
mean nothin' at all, not at all.

She turned on that L.A. station couldn't believe what she 
heard at all.
She started dancin' to that fine fine music, her life was
saved by rock and roll.
