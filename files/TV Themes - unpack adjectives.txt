Unpack Your Adjectives
Came home from camping last spring 
Saw people, places and things 
We barely had arrived, 
Friends asked us to describe 
The people, places and every last thing. 
So we unpacked our adjectives. 

I unpacked "frustrating" first. 
Reached in and found the word "worst." 
Then I picked "soggy" and 
Next I picked "foggy" and 
Then I was ready to tell them my tale. 
Because I'd unpacked my adjectives. 


Adjectives are words you use to really describe things 
Handy words to carry around. 
Days are sunny or they're rainy 
Boys are dumb or else they're brainy 
Adjectives can show you which way. 


Adjectives are often used to help us compare things 
To say how thin how fat how short how tall. 
Girls who are tall can get taller, 
Boys who are small can get smaller, 
Till one is the tallest 
And one is the smallest of all. 


We hiked along without care. 
Then we ran into a bear. 
He was a hairy bear 
He was a scary bear 
We beat a hasty retreat from his lair 
And described him with adjectives. 


Next time you go on a trip 
Remember this little tip 
The minute you get back 
They'll ask you this and that 
You can describe people, places and things 
Simply unpack your adjectives. 
You can do it with adjectives. 
Tell them about it with adjectives. 
You can shout it with adjectives.
