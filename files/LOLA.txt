The Kinks 1970 "Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One" (Ray Davies)
 
[Intro]
 
C  D E
 
[Verse 1]
 
  E
I met her in a club down in old Soho
          A                      D                     E
where you drink champagne and it tastes just like coca cola
         A   Asus4 A
C-O-L-A, cola
    E
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
  A                           D                         E
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola
         A    D             C   C  D  E
L-O-L-A, Lola,  Lo lo lo lo lola
 
[Verse 2]
 
     E
Well I'm not the worlds most physical guy
             A
but when she squeezed me tight
           D                     E
she nearly broke my spine, oh my Lola
            A   Asus4 A
Lo lo lo lo Lola
 
[Verse 3]
 
     E
Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand
        A                       D
why she walked like a woman and talked like a man
      E
oh my Lola
            A    D             C    C D  E
Lo lo lo lo Lola   Lo lo lo lo Lola
 
[Chorus 1]
 
        B7
Well we drank champagne and danced all night
F#
under electric candlelight
    A
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
 
and said 'Dear boy, won't you come home with me'
 
[Verse 4]
 
     E
Well I'm not the world's most passionate guy
           A                         D                  E
but when I looked in her eye, well I almost fell for my Lola
            A   D            C   C  D
Lo lo lo lo Lola Lo lo lo lo Lola
E                  A    D             C    C D    E
Lola,  Lo lo lo lo Lola,  lo lo lo lo Lola
 
[Bridge]
 
  A      E    B *
I pushed her away
  A      E      B
I walked to the door
  A    E      B
I fell to the floor
      E    G#m   C#m
I got down on my knees
     B7
Then I looked at her and she at me
 
[Verse 5]
 
     E
Well that's the way that I want it to stay
      A                 D                  E
and I always want it to be that way for my Lola
            A    Asus4 A
Lo lo lo lo Lola
E
Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
       A                     D                         E
It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world except for Lola
            A
Lo lo lo lo Lola
 
[Chorus 2]
 
       B7
Well I left home just a week before
    F#
And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
A
Lola smiled and took me by the hand
 
and said 'dear boy, I'm gonna make you a man'
 
[Verse 6]
 
     E
Well I'm not the worlds most masculine man
      A                      D
but I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man
          E                 A    D             C    C D
and so is Lola, lo lo lo lo lola   Lo lo lo lo Lola
 
[Outro]
 
E                 A    D             C    C D
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola,  lo lo lo lo Lola
E                 A    D             C    C D
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola,  lo lo lo lo Lola
E                 A    D             C    C D E
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola,   o lo lo lo Lola
