thunder thighs 
blankweighted but nice bright blue eyes
thunder thighs 
blankweight but sweet blue eyes
sucks a mean dick and knows a lot of tricks about the way to make a guy feel like shit
when he wants to go away

he'll take you out to the park
A9         Cmaj7      C9
and throw you down in the dark
A9         Cmaj7      C9
but in the morning there wont be a spark left on his face

just go away thunder thighs
disguise yourself as a sister or wife
thunder thighs
big blue eyes can't hide your blankweight size

A9         Cmaj7      C9
pock marked and hairy
A9         Cmaj7      C9
a little scary
A9         Cmaj7      C9
I'm feeling very naughty yesterday

why did you put heidi klum's picture in your nerve profile
baby you don't even have a tooth left for a moldy smile
thunder thighs
blankweight and dark blue eyes
you'll make a black man happy
he might get slappy
but he's not the type to bring home to mom 
you might make cheeseburger sneeze
but you won't get a disease

A9         Cmaj7      C9
channel i fell through
A9         Cmaj7      C9
been meaning to call you at home
A9         Cmaj7      C9
it's hard when you're single in the city
A9         Cmaj7      C9
but it's hard when you have a crooked nose

thunder thighs
fishnet weight disguise big blue eyes
superdisguise
big mac n fries
burst your thighs
and now you cry
thunder thighs
blank weight and nice blue eyes
thunder thighs
i apologize for being shallow
