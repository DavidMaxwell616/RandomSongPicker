Munjed's Iraqi owner ran an east side eatery. 
He fed Munjed's family to local stoners and put their
skins on the walls for scenery

Munjed grew up eating scraps that the dishwashers
threw out the back. He soon became healthy but fat
servings of vengeance he swore stacks

One day, Munjed's owner, now aged and alone,
staggered out the back and headed for home. 
After gnawing on some of his favorite nephews bones,
Munjed leapt ferociously upon the schwarma serving gnome

Now Munjed's got his own cafe 
and serves pieces of his owners every damn day. 
Serves them roasted, char-broiled and fried. 
It's the newest taste sensation on the lower east side.
