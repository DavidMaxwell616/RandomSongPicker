    D                     G              D
One evening after dark, I met her in the park
                                   A
I knew my time to fall in love had come
   D                   G           D
I lifted up my hat and we began to chat
     D                 A              D       
she said that I could see her at her home

        G                             D
Such a star I've never seen she's as pretty as a queen 
    A
as lovely as an angel from above
          D                      G            D
If she'd only be my wife I'd be happy all my life
        D          A          D 
that aggravating beauty Lula Walls

One evening it was late and I met her at the gate
she said that she would wed me in the Fall
but no answer would she say and only turned away
that aggravating beauty Lula Walls

Oh if she were only mine I'd build a mansion fine
and around it I'd build a fence so tall
And I would so jealous be if any one but me
could gaze upon the beauty of Lula Walls
