D   G               D   G
I'm waitin' for my man

D   G               D   G
26 dollars in my hand

D                F#    G               [G G# A D C A G F]         
Up to Lexington, 125, feel sick and dirty more dead than alive

D   G               D   G
I'm waitin' for my man

Hey white boy, what you doin' uptown?
Hey white boy, you chasin' our women around?
Oh pardon me sir, it's furthest from my mind,
I'm just lookin' for a dear dear friend of mine
I'm waitin' for my man

Here he comes all dressed in black
Pior shoes and a big straw hat
He's never early he's always late
First thing you learn is that you always have to wait
Oh work it now

Up to a brownstone, up three flights of stairs
Look out everybody's pinned you (?) but nobody cares
He's got the works, here's your sweet taste
Ah then you got to split cause you got no time to waste
I'm waitin for my man

Baby don't you holler, darlin' don't you bawl and shout
I'm feelin good, you know I'm gonna work it on out
I'm feelin good, I feel oh so fine
Until tomorrow, but that's just another time
I'm waitin for my man

It's also cool if you do some quick Dsus4 and Gsus4 in between the D-G parts:

Enjoy!
