Here's the lyrics and chords to Poison Ivy.
This is taken from the Coaster's 45 rpm reissue
with "Idol with the Golden Head" on the flip side.
I've changed the key from Ab to G.
The chord transpositions are at the end. 


                Poison Ivy 
     
           by  Lieber and Stoller

G  GGFFG  G  GGFFG


G                       GGFFG  G                  GGFFG
She comes on like a rose       but everybody knows
G                      GGFFG    G   
she'll get you in Dutch you can look but you'd better not touch

       Em           Bm          Em 
Poison Ivy   Poison Ivy Late at night while you're sleeping
A                        Em    D
Poison Ivy comes creeping around



She's pretty as a daisy but look out man she's crazy
she'll really do you in if you let her get under your skin


C
Measles make you mumpy and mumps will make you lumpy
G
and chicken pox will make you jump and switch
C
A common cold will fool you and whooping cough can cool ya
       D
But Poison Ivy lord will make you itch


Your gonna need an ocean             - verse
of calamine lotion
You'll be scratching like a hound
the minute you start to mess around

CHORUS - BRIDGE - REPEAT LAST VERSE - CHORUS

La la la la   - verse
la la la la
la la la la
