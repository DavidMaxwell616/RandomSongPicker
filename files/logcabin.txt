LOG CABIN BY BLIND BOY FULLER
1 (3?) 6 2 5 Rag in C

Come on down to my log cabin everybody's there but me
Come on down to my log cabin ain't so far, you see
My log cabin sits right on the hill
Get your liquor from dairy goat's still
Come on down to my log cabin everybody's there but me
I mean, everybody's there but me

Got a cook in there cookin' collard greens
Prettiest women you ever seen

Cook's in the kitchen cookin your ham
She don't get none, she don't give a damn

scat

I have a little whiskey that will go to your head
Pull up the covers you can go to bed

that rooster chews tobacco, that hen dips snuff
then walks around  struttin his stuff
