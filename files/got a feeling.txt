GOT A FEELING

Got a feeling that I'm wasting time on you babe
Got a feeling that you've been untrue
I got a feeling that you're stealing
All the love I thought I was giving to you
Baby it's true

Got a feeling that you're playing some game with me babe
Got a feeling that you just can't see
If you're entertaining any thought that you're gaining
By causing me all of this pain and making me blue
The joke's on you

When I get to feeling that you're stealing love
And I don't know why
It makes me so discouraged
I finally get the courage not to cry babe
Or even try babe

Got a feeling that I'm wasting time on you babe
Got a feeling that you've been untrue
I got a feeling that you're stealing
All the love I thought I was giving to you
Baby it's true, the joke's on you (2x)
