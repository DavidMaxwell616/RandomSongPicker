				Alone & Easy Target (easy_target.crd)
				Foo Fighters


I know that this has been posted already, but I think that there is a 
better way to play it (without using dropped D tuning)  Plus, here are 
the lyrics:

INTRO:
Guitar 1:  (D Dsus D Dsus D Dsus)  F#7   E7
Guitar 2:  D---------------------------------   F#7   E7


VERSE:

D Dsus D Dsus D Dsus
they knew all along

F#7                     E7
they're not dumb, they were so wrong

D Dsus D Dsus D Dsus
she's not always fun

F#7             E7
hate it now, call when I'm done

D Dsus D Dsus D Dsus
pieces fell in place

F#7   	          E7
puzzles suck, laugh in my face

D Dsus D Dsus D Dsus
turn and swing the pace

F#7   	      E7
I'll give this, keep the good waist


CHORUS:

D          G
head is on
D         A
I want out
C		      A
I'm alone and I'm an easy target
D       G
metronome
D       A
I want out
C		      A
I'm alone and I'm an easy target


VERSE 2:

D Dsus D Dsus D Dsus
crazy t.v. dreams

F#7   	          E7
might be true, not what it seems.

D Dsus D Dsus D Dsus
food and cavitys,

F#7   	           E7
chewing words, tear at the seams

D Dsus D Dsus D Dsus
he don't feel so good,

F#7   	         E7
don't feel bad, not that he should

D Dsus D Dsus D Dsus
i don't feel so good,

F#7   	        E7
don't feel bad,not that i should


BRIDGE:

G         		     Bb
Did you ever listen?
G         		     Bb
Did you ever listen?
G         		     Bb
Did you ever listen?
A        			C
Get out, get out, get out!
A        			C
Get out, get out, get out!

etc...


Personally, I think the Foo Fighters are incredible and its too bad that 
the only reason that they get airplay is because of Dave Grohl (At least 
around here.  They can't play a single song without
mentioning that he used to play w/ Nirvana)  The whole album kicks ass, 
and I can't wait for them to get out to Chicago.  BTW- I figured out 
Wattershed also.  I tab it when I get the time.  E-mail me
with suggestions, corrections, or just to talk about cool music.  Thanks.
