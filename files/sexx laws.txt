1. Sexx Laws


G                     E
can't you hear those cavalry drums?
G                 E
hijacking your equilibrium
G                       E
midnight snacks in the mausoleum
          F                 D
where the pixilated doctors moan

carnivores in the Kowloon night
breathin' freon by the candlelight
coquettes bitch-slap you so polite
'til you thank them for the tea and sympathy

C                  E               A
I wanna defy the logic of all sex laws
         D#          *          
let the handcuffs slip off your wrists
      D              C   
I'll let you be my chaperone at the halfway home
                             F    F#        G
I'm a full-grown man but I'm not afraid to cry

Neptune's lips taste like fermented wine
perfumed blokes on the Ginza line
runnin' buck wild like a concubine
whose mother never held her hand

brief encounters in Mercedes Benz
wearin' hepatitis contact lens
bed and breakfast getaway weekends
with Sports Illustrated moms

I wanna defy the logic of all sex laws
let the handcuffs slip off your wrists
I'll let you be my chaperone at the halfway home
I'm a full-grown man but I'm not afraid to cry
