Promises of a new life
Ring Hollow in your ear
Preening like a naked laughing emperor
Choking back the tears
Precocious teens and pretentious queens
Whinging your way through 
a half hearted coup d'etat
Confidence is a myth
betrayed by a daydream
Puntual vacuum
reviled at midnight
defiled at dawn
Confidence is a myth
it was just a joke
no one's ever really kidding
