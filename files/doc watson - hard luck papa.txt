Brown's Ferry Blues


Hard luck poppa counting his toes
You can smell his feet wherever he goes
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues
Hard luck poppa don't do his stiff
Trouble with him he's been too rough
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues


Two old maids a-sitting in the sand
Each one wishing that the other was a man
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues
Two old maids done lost their style
If you want to be lucky, you got to smile
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues

Early to bed and early to rise
And your girl goes out with other guys
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues
If you don't bvelieve me, try it yourself
Well, I tried it and I got left
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues

Hard luck poppa standing in the rain
If the world was corn, he couldn't buy grain
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues
He runs around in second hand clothes
You can smell his feet wherever he goes
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues

Hard luck poppa coming down the lane
Mama give him back his walking cane
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues
Throwed it away and went to town
to see that woman and now he's down
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues

Hard luck papa getting too tight
if he don't quit drinking he'll be high as a kite
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues
He's drinking that block and tackle kind
he can walk a block and tackle a lion
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues

I walked up to my girl's old man
and asked him for my sweetheart's hand
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues
He said you are a little galoot
and instead of her hand I got his foot
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues

Revenue man took my gin
I hope he don't come back again
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues
