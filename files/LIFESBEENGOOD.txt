      Life's Been Good    - Joe Walsh

As this is quite a long song, I'll start the ball rolling with the
intro riff

The last A chord is where the other instruments come in

He carries on playing this riff while the slide guitar etc play
other stuff


Then after 8 or 16 bars the acoustic guitar comes in with :

    F       C      F      F       C      F      Am      G      Am    G
E---5-5-5---3-3-3--1-1----5-5-5---3-3-3--1-1----5-5-5---3-3-3--0-0-0-0----
B---6-6-6---5-5-5--1-1----6-6-6---5-5-5--1-1----5-5-5---3-3-3--1-1-0-0h1--
G---5-5-5---5-5-5--2-2----5-5-5---5-5-5--2-2----5-5-5---4-4-4--2-2-0-0h2--


Then a little lead in on the electric:

D------0-2-3
A---3-------




F         C/E         Dm          C 
I have a mansion but forget the price
F           C/E               Dm          C 
Ain't never been there, they tell me its nice
F         C/E      Dm           C 
I live in hotels, tear out the walls
F         C/E      Dm          C 
I have accountants pay for it all

 G            FaddG       C                   G 
They say I'm crazy but I have a have a good time
 G            FaddG       C                   G 
I'm just looking for clues at the scene of the crime
              c     G/B    A   
Life's been good to me so far

My Maseratti does one-eighty-five
I lost my license, now I dont drive
I have a limo, ride in the back
I lock the doors in case I'm attacked

I'm making records, my fans they can't wait
They write me letters, tell me I'm great
So I got me an office, gold records on the wall
Just leave a message, maybe I'll call

Lucky I'm sane after all I've been through
I cant complain but sometimes I still do
Life's been good to me so far

I go to parties sometimes until four
It's hard to leave when you can't find the door
It's tough to handle this fortune and fame
Everybody's so different, I haven't changed

They say I'm lazy but it takes all my time
I keep on goin' guess I'll never know why
Life's been good to me so far 


(repeat once)

then:




Shapes:

EADGBE     EADGBE
xx3213     x20003

 FaddG       G/B
I think you know the others....


Hope this gets you started- the rest of the song is mostly repeats
and variations on these bits i.e the intro riff, acoustic chords
and the main body of the song (the bit above with the chords)

Hope y'all enjoy!

Jaime
