Careless Love - G D G D G C G D7 G
(Love, oh love oh careless love) 3X
See what love has done to me
(Down in the valley on my knees)3X
Singing Lord have mercy on me
(I cried last night and the night before)3X
Gonna cry tonight and then no more
(How I wish that train would come)3X
Itâ€™d carry me back where I come from
