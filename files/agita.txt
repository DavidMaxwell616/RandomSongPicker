Well I've got a long way to go   
        A     D          A    D    A D A D
and it plainly shows to all, I know. 
Got my back up against the wall but it’ll take more than you to make me crawl.
It's a long and twisted road and 
I honor only those friends that showed 
My amber dear is clear and near 
the veneer is smeared with beer and tears 

C            G     A
Hungover on you tonight, 
C                 G 
cuddling with ten high 
                A
cause it don't bite. 
C                  G        
I don't break my bottle or balls 
    A
for nobody. 
    F                G
My mind, liver and lungs belong to 
A 
Marlbuddy. 

If I'm feeling like I’m dying 
Only one of my friends can ease my mind. 
Her face is fine her body divine and 
her parents are corn and barley and rye.
If you can believe the only 
kind of love I could never leave 
The one that gives relief is 
the one with no tricks up its sleeve. 

Save those untrained judgments for yourself
Cirrhosis would be heaven to 
your sober hell
I don’t need your approval chains no more
Now that I’ve got the Circle Liquor Store 

So I’ve very far from healed and my fate is signed delivered and sealed
My ever desperate lonely plan ignites the truth and frees the man
Distill the angst and cleanse the soul so pack yourself another healthy bowl
I don’t need to impress no one 
because the fight is done and won
Sick of wading through the 
bullshit of your mind
While you keep looking for a man 
you’ll never find
I’m floating down streams of sourmash bliss 
all the endless vicious circles on the bar I'll never miss

"Don't wipe'em away yet, Nat."
