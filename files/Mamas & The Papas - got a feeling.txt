GOT A FEELING 
(Phillips/Doherty)
The Mamas & The Papas


G#                              B
Got a feelin' that I'm wastin' time on you babe
G#
Got a feelin' that you've been untrue
E
I got a feelin' that you're stealin'
E                                       G#
All the love I thought I was givin' to you
           B
Baby it's true
  
Got a feelin' that you're playin' some game with me babe
Got a feelin' that you just can't see
If you're entertainin' any thought that you're gainin'
By causin' me all of this pain and makin' me blue
The joke's on you
 
A#m                                   B
When I get to feelin' that you're stealin' love
       E          Bm
And I don't know why
A#m
It makes me so discouraged
B                                 E
I finally get the courage not to cry babe
         D#
Or even try babe
 
 
Got a feelin' that I'm wastin' time on you babe
Got a feelin' that you've been untrue
I got a feelin' that you're stealin'
All the love I thought I was givin' to you
Baby it's true, the joke's on you
Baby it's true, the joke's on you
