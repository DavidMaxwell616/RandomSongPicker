Intro: E5 F5 G5 C5

D                    A                      E 
You ride on the swing in and laughs on the bars
D            A                  E 
Capturing moments of life in a jar
D            A                  B 
Playing with children, acting as stars
D            A           E          D        E        F#
Guiding your visions to heaven and heaven is in your mind

Take extra care not to lose what up feel
The apple you're eating is simple and real
So what are the powers that pull at you heel
guiding your visions to heaven and heaven is in your mind
