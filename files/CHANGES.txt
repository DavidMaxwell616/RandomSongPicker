               C                           Em
               I Still dont know what i was waiting for
                            F                G  
                     And my time was running wild,
                                F
                      A million dead-end streets.
                  C                         Em
               And every time i thought i'd got it made
                               F                      G13
                  It seems the taste was not so sweet,
                         C         Dm7     Em7    Ebm7
                    So i turned my self to face me
                        Dm7                        G7
                    But I've never caught a glimpse
                            C           Dm7          Em7 Ebm7
                 Of how the others must see the faker
                               Dm7               G7
                  I'm much too fast to take that test

                     F          C        Em       Am
              Ch-ch-ch-changes, turn and face the strange.
                    C          F    Am                    D
              Ch-ch-ch-changes, you wanna be a richer man,
            G7         F        C        Em       Am       C  F
              Ch-ch-ch-changes, turn and face the strange.
                          Am                   D
                     It's gonna be a different man.
              Am   G   Bb(add 9)  F         Am G    G11   C
              Time may change     me -- but i  cant trace time

                             -- oh yeah --

                 I watch the ripples change their size
                       But never leave the stream
                         Of warm impermanence.
                   And so the days flow thru my eyes
                   But the days still seem the same.
                     And this children you spit on
                   As they try to change their worlds,
                   Are immune to your consultations.
            Theyr'e quite aware of what they're going thru.

              Ch-ch-ch-changes, turn and face the strange
      Ch-ch-ch-changes, don't tell them to grow up and out of it.
              Ch-ch-ch-changes, turn and face the strange
                 Ch-ch-ch-changes, there's your shame,
                  you've left us up yo our neck in it.
             Time may change me, but you can't trace time.

                  Strange fascination fascinating me.
            Oh changes are taking the place I'm going thru.
              Ch-ch-ch-changes, turn and face the strange,
           Ch-ch-ch-changes, Oh look out you Rock 'n rollers
              Ch-ch-ch-changes, turn and face the strange
   Ch-ch-ch-changes, pretty soon now you're gonna get a little older.
              Time may change me, But i can't trace time.
